        <p>Last game before the Christmas break and teddy bear toss night, the Canes had every reason to put on a show and enter the festive break with a big win against a team that has beaten them twice so far this season.</p>

<p>The Canes were looking for revenge and with the spirits high in the Lethbridge camp this was the game to show the Teddy Bear toss fans, that we are now back on track and things are going well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6529100055/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7023/6529100055_1fc0445cac_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>The game started at a lightening pace and it was all Broncos for the first few minutes, but after Groenheyde went after Russ Maxwell after the whistle, the Broncos goaltender was called for un-sportsman like conduct and the Canes got the first power play of the game. This was turning in to a hotly contested and feisty game. It was end to end play with the Canes having several good chances to open the scoring, but the Broncos defense were strong at the back and snuffed out anything that threatened their goal. 
At the other End Damien Ketlo played like a man possessed, doing back flips to keep the Broncos out and the game scoreless after 20 minutes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6529300671/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7033/6529300671_5d02d06362_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>With the fans calling for a goal, they didn’t have to wait long as Graham Hood cleaned up on the doorstep after good work from Philip Tot and Brody Sutter on the power play. Interestingly, Broncos goaltender Jon Grodheyde, had to be escorted off the ice by the officials as he tried to have a fight with Spencer Galbraith with the teddy bears raining down.
Almost immediately after the restart, Macoy Erkamps is called for holding, and with the Canes on the Penalty kill, Cam Braes gets down to block a shot, forces the turnover, gets up to recover the puck and with a snipers goal skates the length of the ice to hit the top corner and double the Hurricanes lead, 2-0.</p>

<p>The Broncos tried to get under Russ Maxwell&#39;s skin and after Lowry went after him for a cross check, Jaimen Yakubowski was called for unsprotsmanlike, got 10 and Maxweel and Erkamps got 2 each to give the Broncos the powerplay. Lowry sat for 2 after roughing up the smallest player on the ice.</p>

<p>Revenge is truly a dish best served cold, and after the Hurricanes killed the penalty and all the players involved got to cool down for 2 minutes, Russell got on the score sheet poking it home after Groenheyde thought he had it covered to give the Canes a 3 goal lead, 3-0.</p>

<p>The Broncos got one back with an exquisite wrister from Gordon, to make it a 2 goal game. Nothing Damien Kelto could have done with the Bronco&#39;s sniper shot beating him high on the blocker shot</p>

<p>The period ended with more chirping which eventually led to Spencer Galbraith being given a 10 minute game misconduct for spednign the best part of 2 periods winding up the Broncos.</p>

<p>The third started with more sustained pressure from the Canes and as the penalty on Alvin Blomqvist came to an end, a sublime feed had him all alone with only Groenheyde to beat as he scored his first WHL goal making it 4-1 Hurrcanes.</p>

<p>That goal herralded the swapping out of goalies as Groenheyde left the ice to be replaced by Austin Smith.</p>

<p>There were chances for both sides as the game continued to be a fiery and well contested.</p>

<p>There really is no love lost between these two sides and after a Juraj Bezuch hip check was called for clipping with 18 seconds left in the game, Flemming pretty much played the hitman as he hit Bezuch with a big, and I mean big slash to the legs takes him down and cause several fights.</p>

<p>Once everything had been sorted out and Cave got 10, Flemming got 10 + 5 (slash), Bezuch got 10 + 5 (clip) and Blomqvist got 10.</p>

<p>The Canes ran out 4-1 winners having been outshot 36-25 in regulation</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>Playing as a team; with every player giving his all, the Hurricanes head into the Christmas break as big time winners.</p>

<h2><em><a href="http://lethbridgewebdesign.ca">Lethbridge Web Design</a></em> Hardest Working Hurricane Damien Ketlo</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6529210927/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7162/6529210927_aedca7954a_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>Played like an NHL goaltender with cat like reflexes, even backflipping to keep the Hurricanes in the game, building on his confidence showing he is just ‘on fire’ at the moment.
Easily Damien Ketlo’s finest game in a Hurricanes uniform!</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>The Canes keep on improving having now posted an impressive 8 wins in their last 10, going unbeaten at home for the last 6 games. 2012 sure looks like it will bring a different set of results to the erlier part of the season as this relatively young Lethbridge team continues to find it’s feet and show what it is capable of. </p>

<h2>Next up</h2>

<p>The Hurricanes take a well deserved rest ovewr the Christmas period and return to action with a road game against the Kootenay Ice on the  27th December, Puck drops at 7:00pm</p>
