        <div class="byline">December 01, 2011 - by Josh Schroeder</div>
        
        <p>The Lethbridge Hurricanes’ month of November came to a close Wednesday night in Medicine Hat against the rival Tigers. Life didn’t look any easier coming into this game; Phil Tot joins Macoy Erkamps and Daniel Johnston as recently injured, and Graham Hood sits out after being suspended for a hit on Josh Cowen on Tuesday night. On a positive note, Juraj Bezuch and Albin Blomqvist return after missing a game due to the flu. The injury situation resulted in Cam Braes moving back to defence again tonight.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>Just like on Tuesday night, this game opened on a long uninterrupted run, lasting about five minutes before the first stoppage when Tyler Bunz smothered a shot by Sam Mckechnie. In the back half of the first period Emerson Etem got a step around Albin Blomqvist and drew a slashing penalty as he drove to the Hurricane net. The Tigers capitalized on the ensuing powerplay when James Bettauer fired a slap shot from the blue line through traffic and past Ketlo.</p>

<p>It was all Medicine Hat to open the second period as they applied consistent pressure to keep the Hurricanes on their heels. Nearing the six minute mark of the period, the Tigers doubled their lead when Jayden Hart redirected a Matthew Konan point shot by Ketlo on the powerplay. Things looked bad for the Hurricanes after this when Spencer Galbraith left the game after blocking a shot, and Craig Leverton followed a short time later following a collision. Galbraith returned later in the period, but Leverton did not. The tides started to turn when Cole Grbavac was called for a slash on Nick Buonassisi with about six minutes to play in the period. The Hurricanes capitalized on the powerplay thanks to a slick no-look behind-the-back pass by Buonassisi to Brady Ramsay who buried his 11th of the season. Less than two minutes later Jamal Watson made a deke through the legs of a Medicine Hat defender and walked in alone on Bunz, beating him with a quick shot high glove side. Sam Mckechnie gave the Hurricanes their first lead with just over a minute remaining in the period, collecting a loose puck at the top of the crease and lifting it over Bunz.</p>

<p>Early in the third period with a brief 5-on-3 powerplay, Brody Sutter won a faceoff back to Cam Braes who fired a wrist shot top corner to extend the lead to 4-2. The Tigers clawed a little closer thanks to Ramsay taking a slashing penalty and Sutter following it up with a delay of game infraction. It didn’t help matters that Cam Braes broke his stick on the ensuing face-off, all leading to a big one-timer from Bettauer that Ketlo couldn’t get across in time to stop. That was as close as the Tigers could come, though, and the Hurricanes ended up missing the open net twice in the dying seconds.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>...why the Hurricanes won. They got some timely goal scoring in the second period. This game could have pretty easily gone the other way, but a couple of nice plays in the offensive zone turned the tables.</p>

<p>Peter Loubardias, commentating the game for Shaw tonight, actually said something along the lines of “if you were to pick a hardest working Hurricane tonight” ... Well, I couldn’t agree more with Loubardias’ pick tonight in going with Sam Mckechnie. He put his speed to good use once again on the forecheck, forcing turnovers and generating scoring opportunities. It all paid off with Mckechnie&#39;s third goal of the season to give the Hurricanes a 3-2 lead in the second period.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>A four game in six night stretch wraps up a third win and a moderate two day break to rest up. The blue line should get a boost with the anticipated return of Johnston and Erkamps for the weekend. The Hurricanes host the Saskatoon Blades at the Enmax, 7:00 on Saturday, and the Spokane Chiefs at 6:00 on Sunday. Call (403)329-SEAT for tickets.</p>
