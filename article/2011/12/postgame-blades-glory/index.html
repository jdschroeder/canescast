        <div class="byline">December 04, 2011 - by Mark Huxley</div>
        
        <p>With a resurgence worthy of a Hollywood movie, the Lethbridge Hurricanes played host to the Saskatoon Blades having won 5 of their last 7 giving them a record thus far of 8-20-0-1. Quite the turnaround from the start of the season that saw them win 2 of their first 3, then go on a 13 game losing streak.</p>

<p>With the Canes a little light on the roster after losing Craig Leverton with a shoulder injury and Graham Hood serving the second of a 3 game suspension for what was adjudged to be a blind sided hit on Cowen during the win in Red Deer, Tyler Wong was called up for this one. 
Reid Duke stayed on the team sheet for what would be his fifth and last game for the Hurricanes this season, having played the maximum allowed for a 15 year old before he had to return to his midget team. Reid has looked every bit a top pick and has not looked at all out of place in the WHL. 
Like most Caniacs I am chomping at the bit to see him suit up for a full season.</p>

<p>The Canes arrived back at the Enmax, having won 2 in a row, as they hung on to edge the Tabbies 4-3 on Wednesday, having beaten the Red Deer Rebels, 3-1 the night before.</p>

<p>The Blades arrive in southern Alberta on top of the east division and in second place in the eastern conference with a record of 19-9-0-1.</p>

<p>The key to this game was the ability of the Hurricanes to play a physical game, which had proven effective against Red Deer, Edmonton and Medicine Hat.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6450235077/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7151/6450235077_456c175b66_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>The game started with the Blades skating hard at the Hurricanes as they struggled to keep up with the pace set by Saskatoon, however, with almost their first attack of the game, Lethbridge scored after good work from Russ Maxwell, gave Sam McKechnie the chance in front to collect his own rebound and put the Canes up 1-0.
Damien Ketlo was immense in goal as he made save after save to keep the Blades at bay as they made foray after foray into the Canes blue zone, unable to beat the Lethbridge goaltender.</p>

<p>More pressure from the Blades as the period ended but the Canes survived to close out the period up by a goal, having been outshot 29-7 after 20 minutes.</p>

<p>The second started with the Canes defending their net heavily as the Blades continued to pepper the Lethbridge goal.</p>

<p>Pretty much against the run of play, Nick Buonassisi picked up a pass from Jamal Watson and after Todd can&#39;t quite keep hold of it, his speculative wrister trickled in doubling the Canes lead, 2-0.</p>

<p>With the Canes on the ascendancy, they grew in confidence, generating more chances in the second period, however, after a wicked deflection off Macoy Erkamps stick hit the top corner of Ketlo&#39;s goal, the Blades made it a one goal game. </p>

<p>Less than a minute later, the Blades beat Ketlo again sneaking the puck through the 5 hole from a tight angle to tie it up at 2 goals apiece.</p>

<p>A sense of dread entered the Enmax as Caniacs were left hoping that they weren&#39;t about to see a collapse to spoil what had been a spirited Hurricanes performance so far..... They were not to be disappointed as the Canes continued to play hard and put the 5th best team in the league under lots of pressure.</p>

<p>Russ Maxwell go his just dessert after creating several chances in the offensive zone as he combined well with the increasingly impressive Sam McKechnie to restore the Hurricanes lead less that 30 seconds after Saskatoon had tied things up. 3-2 Hurricanes.</p>

<p>With further opportunities to increase their lead, Erkamps, Braes and Buonassisi all had chances as the Canes continued to play with confidence, but couldn&#39;t find the net keeping things tight with a one goal lead.</p>

<p>Canes got 14 shots to Saskatoon&#39;s 16 on net during the 2nd, to leave the shot clock at 21-39 in the Blades favour.</p>

<p>The third got underway with everything still to do and the Hurricanes didn&#39;t waste any time as rookie Jaimen Yakobowski got what was to be the winning goal after closing in on the Saskatoon goal from the slot to get a tip to the puck and force it past Todd struggled to gather the puck, 4-2.</p>

<p>Jay Merkley made it 5-2 on the power play after some nice work in front, to pretty much assure the Canes of the points and put another plus in the win column.</p>

<p>Some nice skating and crisscross play left Ketlo scrambling and gave the Blades a lifeline with 6 minutes left as Saskatoon started to rally, but even with a sustained period of pressure on the Lethbridge net minder, &#39;Kets&#39; showed his outstanding skills to continue to deny the Blades as they threw everything they could on net.</p>

<p>After the Blades pulled their goaltender for an extra attacker in the last minutes of the game, Captain Cam Braes made sure of the victory slotting the empty netter the length of the ice and into the middle of the goal, 6-3.</p>

<p>The game finished with the combined total of shots reaching 90 for both teams with the Hurricanes having been outshot 55 - 35, but running out 6-3 winners to take their unbeaten run to 3 games.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>The Hurricanes won this one due in large part to Damien Ketlo who was a force to be reckoned with, standing on his head to deny the Blades scoring opportunities time and time again, that combined with a return to more physical play ensured that the Canes took the plaudits in this fiercely contested game.
When the Canes backed off and allowed Saskatoon to play, they were always on the back foot, struggling at times to get out of their own zone. When they returned to the physical game that has seen resurgence in their form this season, they were able to break up the Blades play, force the turnovers and create chances in the offensive zone.</p>

<p>Veteran goaltender Damien Ketlo who made 52 saves to lead the Hurricanes to their third win in a row and back up some great offensive play from his forward lines.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>Another spirited performance from the Hurricanes who have now won 6 of their last 8, a feat that shows the character and team spirit that continues to propel the Canes away from the basement of the eastern conference.</p>

<p>Next up the Hurricanes play host to the Spokane Chiefs who beat the Tabbies 6-3 in their last game. 
Puck drops at 6:00pm on Sunday, 4th December.</p>
