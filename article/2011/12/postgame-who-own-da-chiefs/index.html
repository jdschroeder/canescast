        <p>After a lesson in goaltending from Damein Ketlo on Saturday night as the Hurricanes stepped up their game to beat the Saskatoon Blades 6-3, the Canes played host to the Spokane Chiefs on Sunday, who arrive in Lethbridge having won 2 and lost 2 of their last 4 road games.</p>

<p>With the Canes winning their last 3 games and chalking up 6 wins in the last 8, the Hurricanes continue to improve after what can only be described as a stuttering start to their season. They are now bouncing back in no uncertain terms and prior to this game held a record of 9-20-0-1.</p>

<p>The Chiefs arrive at the Enmax with a mid table record of 13-8-2-2 with this, the last of 3 road games in 3 nights for the team south west of the border.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6456784239/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7157/6456784239_5509fd80b2_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>Spokane were quick out of the gate putting pressure on Lethbridge from the off, taking the game to the Hurricanes who didn&#39;t register a shot on goal until Sam McKechnie drove the Chief&#39;s net with 8 minutes gone in the first.
The Chiefs came with the aim of matching the physical nature of the Canes play and did so admirably for the majority of the first period.</p>

<p>With Tyler Wong, dressing for his second game in a row for the Canes, the underager took a high sticking penalty which once the Canes had killed the penalty off, gave them the jump they needed to start imposing themselves on the game. 
They registered  a couple of quick shots as Jaimen Yakubowski and Sam McKechnie got a couple of wristers on the Spokane net, but nothing that really threatening to beat Mac Engel, in goal for the Chiefs.</p>

<p>Worryingly, Brody Sutter limped off the ice after blocking a shot on the penalty kill, the Canes needing no further injuries after having battled to keep a fully fit roster of players dressed so far this season. 
Unfortunately, Sutter left the game soon after and didn&#39;t return as he took treatment for the knock to the ankle he received defending the Spokane power play.</p>

<p>A great defensive performance involving a lot of bodies getting down to block some big shots along with goal tending excellence of Liam Liston, kept the game scoreless after 20 minutes with the Spokane Chiefs having outshot the Hurricanes by a massive 13 shots, 17-4.</p>

<p>The second period was a more even affair with the Canes creating several good chances to open the scoring.</p>

<p>Great link up play between Jaimen Yakubowski, Russ Maxwell, and Sam McKechnie led to several openings as Liston continued where he left off in the first making several instinctive saves to keep the Chiefs off the scoresheet.</p>

<p>After Macoy Erkamps broke up a sustained period of Spokane pressure, he sent Jamal Watson free and after great stick work to open up the Spokane defence, was taken down and was awarded a penalty shot.</p>

<p>However, good work from Engel to close down the angles and make the poke check after slowing Watson up before he could get a decent shot away, and with it the chance to take the lead went begging.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6458101459/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7143/6458101459_daac9e9e1f_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>More chances for both sides saw Liston playing out of his skin as he made save after save to ensure the Chiefs had nothing to celebrate during the second period.</p>

<p>With great chances for both sides in a much more evenly matched second, the Canes went in having outshot the Chiefs 11-10 trailing overall, 15 shots to 27 as the game remained scoreless.</p>

<p>The third continued in the same vein as the second with chances for both sides, but both goal tenders keeping the other team at bay ensured that a nervy end to this game was just around the corner.</p>

<p>Spokane were awarded a penalty shot after having a man brought down on the odd man rush whilst killing a penalty, but Liam Liston stood tall and did enough to put off the Spokane shooter, who shot wide to keep the game scoreless as the Canes looked to be floundering.</p>

<p>With just under 8 minutes left, Captain Cam Braes broke the deadlock with a knee high tip on the power-play after a well threaded centering pass from Nick Buonassisi, from wide right, was steered home. 
1-0 Hurricanes.</p>

<p>A little over six minutes left in this game and the Canes had been outshot 33-18, but through a combination of Liston&#39;s goaltending and awesome defensive work, the Canes were keeping the Chiefs off the scoresheet.</p>

<p>Their discipline and strong defensive play was well illustrated when Holmberg had a gilt edged chance on the rush to get the Chiefs back into the game. However, Liam Liston stood his ground and stopped the shot, making the pad save at full stretch.</p>

<p>More pressure from Spokane allowed Jamal Watson to catch the defence on the break and with a perfectly fed pass, Macoy Erkamps missed high right with just the goal tender to beat.</p>

<p>The Lethbridge crowd could hardly believe it when during a goal mouth scramble, the Canes were adjudged to have knocked their goal off the moorings and Spokane were awarded another penalty shot.</p>

<p>But this was Liston&#39;s night as he was more than equal to the shot, saving well to ensure the Canes kept the lead by a solitary goal. 
Nervous times as the Canes really looked to be undone by that decision.</p>

<p>More drama late on as With 18.5 seconds left, the Canes were called for icing and with the face off in the Canes zone, they were seconds away from winning their 4th in a row, if only they could hold on......</p>

<p>The Hurricanes won this, 1-0, gaining Liam Liston and the Hurricane&#39;s their first shutout of the season with the Hurricanes winning their 4th game in a row, having won 7 of their last 9 games.</p>

<p>The answer to who owns the Chiefs, on tonight&#39;s performance, the Lethbridge Hurricanes!</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>...why the Hurricanes won.</p>

<p>Liam Liston and a team wide defensive performance worthy of a championship winning side. 
Each player stepped up tonight and covered for their team mates. 
Outmatched and outplayed at times, this really was a team effort with Liston taking note of Ketlo&#39;s game winning performance in goal the night before, showed how vital he is to the team and that he is fighting for a place as the starting goal tender.</p>

<p>The spirit in the camp is high and with team mates like this no wonder! 
To a man, not one player went missing this night as they needed everyone to stand up and be counted.</p>

<h2><em><a href="http://lethbridgewebdesign.ca">Lethbridge Web Design</a></em> Hardest Working Hurricane: Liam Liston</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6456836729/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7152/6456836729_46d8d3422a_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>After what seems like just five minutes since Liam Liston arrived in Lethbridge as part of the Brandon Anderson trade, he showed just why he is thought of so highly by the back room staff and team mates alike putting up a 38 save shutout performance to lead the Hurricanes to victory and register their first clean sheet of the season.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>Another character defining performance from a Lethbridge Hurricane side that showed you right them off at your peril. </p>

<p>Next up the Hurricanes start a 3 game road trip to BC, to take on the Kelowna Rockets in Prospera Place, Kelowna.</p>

<p>Puck drops at 8:05pm on Wednesday, 7th December.</p>
