        <h1>Are the Hurricanes deadline day sellers?</h1>
        <div class="byline">December 29, 2011 - by Josh Schroeder</div>
        
        <p>The WHL trade deadline is fast approaching, and after a quiet WHL transaction wire through most of December, the trades have now started to signal a beginning to the deadline season. As one of the teams likely to miss the playoffs the Hurricanes may be considered <em>sellers</em> when it comes to deadline day. Before we speculate as to what might happen for the Hurricanes prior to or on January 10, let&rsquo;s take a look at Rich Preston&rsquo;s trade history in the month or so leading up to the trade deadline for the last two years.</p>

<h2>2009/10 Deadline</h2>

<h3>December 7</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Hurricanes trade 2011 4th round pick (Matt Murray)<br>
to Kootenay for Cason Machacek</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>December 9</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Hurricanes trade Carter Ashton, Craig Orfino, 2010 3rd round pick (Kyle Burroughs)<br>
to Regina for Graham Hood, Taylor Balog, 2010 2nd round pick (Macoy Erkamps), 2011 1st round pick (Ryan Pilon)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>January 7</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Hurricanes trade Conditional 2011 7th round pick (Kyle Raymond)<br>
to Everett for Drew McDermott</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>January 10</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Hurricanes trade Luca Sbisa, 2010 first round import pick (Sven B&auml;rtschi), 2011 5th round pick (Michael Fortin)<br>
to Portland for Daniel Johnston, Jacob Berglund, 2010 first round import pick (later traded to Regina for 2012 6th round pick)</p>

<p>Hurricanes trade Brent Henke<br>
to Vancouver for 2011 5th round pick (Tyler Wong)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rich Preston&rsquo;s first year as the Hurricanes&rsquo; general manager was a busy one on the trade front. The highlight here is probably acquiring first and second round picks as well as Graham Hood in that Carter Ashton deal. The tandem of Erkamps and Pilon look to be the foundation of the Hurricanes&rsquo; defence in the next few years, while Hood has established himself as a contributing power forward. The low point for me here is probably giving away the pick that was used to select Sven B&auml;rtschi.</p>

<p>It would seem that Preston decided after a few months at the helm that an overhaul of the roster was in order and set about building for the future by moving his most saleable assets. The 2009/10 Hurricanes were the definition of the word <em>sellers</em>.</p>

<h2>2010/11 Deadline</h2>

<h3>December 9</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Hurricanes trade Mark Reners<br>
to Vancouver for 2012 5th round pick</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>December 11</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Hurricanes trade 2011 6th round pick (Ross Hnidy)<br>
to Saskatoon for Tyler Kizuik</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>January 10</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Hurricanes trade Ryley Bennefield<br>
to Portland for Branden Scheidl</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not complete inactivity, but no particularly notable deals last year. The acquisiton of Tyler Kizuik is the most significant move among the three. With fewer big trading chips at his disposal last season, the trades made a far smaller splash and only involved two roster players.</p>

<h2>What might we expect this year?</h2>

<p>Don&rsquo;t excpect to see the Hurricanes making trades just for the sake of making trades. Preston made a splash with three separate deals back on October 16th, and since that time the team&rsquo;s performance has stabilized considerably. It is possible, however, that we could see some trade activity. Each of the Hurricanes&rsquo; 20 year olds offer value for a team looking to make a playoff push, but nearly every team would need to clear an over-age spot to make that possible. A notable exception are the Moose Jaw Warriors who claimed Charles Wells off of waivers from the Portland Winterhawks prior to the Christmas break. Wells has opted not to join the Warriors, leaving an over-age vacancy on the upstart Warriors&rsquo; roster. It is conceivable that Moose Jaw may have interest in the likes of Brody Sutter or Cam Braes to fill that spot. Personally, I find it more likely that Braes remains in Lethbridge as captain through his 20 year old season. If any 20 year old were to be traded my money is on it being Sutter, and between their contender status and over-age vacancy, the Warriors look like a logical destination.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Hurricanes currently have five 19 year old players (Oslanski, Johnston, Kizuik, Hood, and Buonassisi), and Preston has shown a tendency to make moves early to avoid having a glut of over-age players at the start of the season. If trades do start to happen, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see a 19 year old player moved.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the Hurricanes aren&rsquo;t true sellers since they are on the upturn of a significant re-build. Any trades that do occur will likely be to add depth, experience, and perhaps some grit to a fast and talented young core. Don&rsquo;t be disappointed if Preston doesn&rsquo;t make a big splash on January 10; we still have yet to enjoy the fruits of his activity two years ago.</p>
