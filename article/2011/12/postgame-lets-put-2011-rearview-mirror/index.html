        <h1>Postgame: Let's put 2011 in the rearview mirror</h1>
        <div class="byline">December 30, 2011 - by Josh Schroeder</div>
        
        <p>After having their six game home win streak unceremoniously snapped by the Tigers last night, the Hurricanes sought out a little revenge tonight at The Arena, where they’ve won twice already this season. With Tyler Kizuik returning from injury and Harrison Harper still in the line-up, the Hurricanes entered this game with nearly a complete roster. Beyond the motivation of playing the back half of a home and home with your bitter rivals, the Prince Albert Raiders have been playing strong hockey lately and managed to overtake the Hurricanes in the standings last night; there was plenty to get up for in this game tonight.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>It started out rather slowly, neither team able to accomplish much with their attacking. Much of the first period was spent in the neutral zone with shots coming primarily from the perimeter of the zone. The edge went to the Tigers, aided by three powerplay opportunities, and a quick capitalization on one of them, resulting in Jayden Hart converting a cross-crease feed from Hunter Shinkaruk to open the scoring 2:22 into the game.</p>

<p>That’s how the score held until the 5:52 mark of the second period when Kale Kessy continued his strong play against the Hurricanes by deflecting an airborne shot past Damien Ketlo to give the Tigers a 2-0 lead. The Hurricanes got one back at the midway point of the period when Tyler Kizuik fired a point shot wide. The puck caromed off the end board and directly to Jaimen Yakubowski who fired it into the gaping net. Late in the period Cam Braes chased down Hart on a breakaway to knock him off the puck. Despite Braes’ protestations, the referee deemed Braes to have illegally taken Hart down while on a breakaway, resulting in a penalty shot for the Tigers. Hart seemingly overthought his move, though, and Ketlo was able to outwait him, leaving no net to shoot out and keep the deficit to 2-1 through 40 minutes.</p>

<p>Penalty trouble got the best of the Hurricanes in the third period, and it wasn’t just limited to the ice. Head coach Rich Preston earned a bench minor for disputing a non-call, and was soon after ejected from the game for continuing to argue with the officials. Curtis Valk scored on an ensuing 5-on-3 powerplay to give the Tigers a 3-1 lead. Adam Henry tallied his second goal of the season with a rocket from the point that beat Bunz high glove side, but that’s as close as the Hurricanes would come, falling 3-2 to the Tigers.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>... why the Hurricanes lost. Not enough quality scoring chances. It’s been a rare occasion this season when the Hurricanes have outshot their opponents. Tonight they did, but not enough of the 30 shots they directed Tyler Bunz’s way were enough to test the Tiger goalie. Penetrating the middle of the ice, getting into scoring positions and getting traffic in front of the goalie are what they need to do better than tonight in order to score more often.</p>

<p>... Not to mention taking too many penalties (yes, I know that technically that makes this <em>two</em> good reasons). The special teams differential was a notable red flag in tonight’s game. The Hurricanes went 0/4 on the man advantage while the Tigers struck twice while enjoying nine powerplay opportunities. I often suggest that Preston will be unimpressed with his team’s discipline after such performances, but given that he contributed to that total, perhaps he’ll see the blame lying more with the men in stripes tonight.</p>

<p>Phil Tot takes the honour tonight. Tot went into the Christmas break on a high note, picking up five points (1G, 4A) against the Royals and Broncos, but he was held off the scoresheet and a -4 in the two games since. Tonight’s game was statistically unremarkable for Tot, but hard work isn’t measured by goals and assists. He was driving the net hard and clearly looking to make an impact; more points will follow if he continues that sort of play.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>2011 ends on a sour note for the Hurricanes, dropping three games against divisional rivals since the Christmas break and slipping back into the eastern conference basement. The road doesn’t get easier from here as teams look to assert themselves as playoff contenders in the second half of the season. Looking forward, the Canes begin 2012 with four more games against divisional opponents (Kootenay, Edmonton, Medicine Hat, and Calgary), followed by a lengthy road trip to the BC division. The trade deadline also occurs just before the Hurricanes begin that BC road trip, and <a href="http://www.canescast.ca/article/2011/12/are-hurricanes-deadline-day-sellers">as we’ve explored earlier this week</a>, you might see Rich Preston make some moves.</p>

<p>The Hurricanes play only two home games in the first half of January, so make sure to get your Hurricane hockey fix on Monday, January 2 against the Kootenay Ice, and Friday, January 6 for hall of fame induction night against the Medicine Hat Tigers. After that you’ll need to wait until the 25th for the next home game! Visit <a href="http://www.lethbridge.ca/tickets">lethbridge.ca/tickets</a> or call (403)329-SEAT for tickets.</p>
