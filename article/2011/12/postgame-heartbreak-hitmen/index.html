<p>A mixed bag of results after a game they should have won in Victoria and a game everyone thought they would struggle in, the canes went 1 and 2 on their BC road trip after beating the giants in Vancouver for the first time since 2004.</p>

<p>The Hitmen arrived in Lethbridge with a 17-13-1-1 record having won their last 2 home games.</p>

<p>The Canes record of 11-22-0-1 have them putting right what was a disappointing start to the season from which they haven&#39;t looked back since they broke that losing streak at the start of November.</p>

<p>The key to this game would be the Canes defense who need to keep their concentration and not let the Hitmen skate through their zone, unchallenged which has been their undoing in a couple of games recently.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6514020647/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7001/6514020647_8faea138e1_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>Two power play goals from Captain Cam Braes gave the Canes the lead by a pair with less than 5 minutes gone. 
The perfect start as they looked to show the Hitmen that they were a very different team from the one that turned up in Calgary and lost 6-2 in November. 2-0.</p>

<p>After a couple of roughing penalties, the Hitmen got one back as the Lethbridge defense backed off and allowed Brassart too much space, 2-1.</p>

<p>Calgary were in the ascendancy and had to work hard to close down several Hitmen forays into their blue zone. Cam Braes putting his body on the line to block a couple of shots as he again played some stellar defense.</p>

<p>Canes were back on top as Jaimen Yakubowski made it 3-1 with a little under 7 minutes left in the first and the Canes were back to a 2 goal lead.</p>

<p>Hitmen finished the period strongly scoring a goal on the power play to close out the first 3-2 in favor of the Hurricanes. Hitmen leading on the shot clock 19-13.</p>

<p>Canes came out strongly in the second and after a couple of shots close in from Brody Sutter, Graham Hood cleaned up the garbage and the Canes were back to a two goal lead. 4-2.</p>

<p>Russ Maxwell having another strong game, got amongst the Hitmen breaking up their play time after time eventually drawing a slashing penalty with 5 minutes gone in the second. 
Brody Sutter with some inventive play, carved an opening and pinged one off the inside of the upright.</p>

<p>Strong goal tending from Damien Ketlo, kept the Canes in the game as he spread myself well on more than one occasion to deny the Hitmen.
Hitmen again came on strong toward the end of the second, but with great defensive play from the Canes and outstanding goal tending kept the score at 4-2 after 2 periods with the shots 35-21 in favor of Calgary.</p>

<p>The third started with the Canes killing a penalty for Nick Buonassisi&#39;s hit to the head, that just missed. The Hitmen scored on the power play and it was back to a one goal game with the Canes leading 4-3 with the majority of the period left.
Both sides had good chances in front of goal, but it was the Hitmen who scored from the high slot to tie it up 4-4 with Ketlo unsighted.</p>

<p>Back to square one for the Canes with the Hitmen having outshot them 43-24 with 12 minutes left in the game.
The Canes backed off and stopped closing down the Hitmen which gave them lots of space and inevitably, Lethbridge went behind as Calgary rang one in off the post to give the Hitmen their first lead of the game 5-4.</p>

<p>Time for Lethbridge to show their resilience and start creating something in the offensive zone as they struggled to get a shot on goal.</p>

<p>With a minute to go, Rich Preston pulled Damien Ketlo and in a mirror of the Hitmen go ahead goal, Cam Braes rings one off the upright to take the game to OT, 5-5.</p>

<p>With a comeback that lasted a little more than a minute, the Canes won the face-off and with 21 seconds gone, Graham Hood cleans up tight in giving the Hurricanes the win they deserved after soaking up so much Calgary pressure.
Canes win 6-5 having been outshot 47-28.</p>

<h2>Wrap up.</h2>

<p>Even though they showed their defensive frailty in this game, the Canes showed their character along with perfect timing from coach Preston to give the Canes 2 wins in a row and head into the weekend on a roll.</p>

<h2><em><a href="http://lethbridgewebdesign.ca">Lethbridge Web Design</a></em> Hardest Working Hurricane Captain Cam Braes</h2>

<p>Hatrick hero, leading by example, scored when the Canes needed it most and epitomizes the passion and integrity of this Lethbridge team.</p>

<h2>One good reason why they won.</h2>

<p>Captain Cam Braes, he is the driving force and perfect leader on this team and there is nothing he won&#39;t do to help his team win.</p>

<p>Next up: Canes take on the Victoria Royals back at the Enmax as they look to over turn the loss on island last Friday.... Puck drops at 7:00pm.</p>
