        <h1>Mapping the first half playoff race</h1>
        <div class="byline">December 20, 2011 - by Josh Schroeder</div>
        
        <p>The most compelling storyline around the Lethbridge Hurricanes at the mid-way point of the season is the impressive turnaround that they’ve put together since the end of October. As we’ve been hearing lately, the ‘Canes have gone from being 23 points out of a playoff spot to only eight back at the Christmas break. Not that I want to pour cold water on the recent turnaround, but it isn’t entirely accurate to say that the Hurricanes have made up 15 points in the playoff race. Here’s why:</p>

<p>The problem with comparing point totals between teams is that the league schedule isn’t balanced. Some teams have played more games than other teams at any given point of a mid-season schedule, and at this point the Hurricanes have played the highest number of games of anybody in the WHL’s Eastern Conference (37, the same number as Regina and Prince Albert). Because most teams in the conference have games at hand on the Hurricanes, the eight point deficit can be misleading; eight points is a best case scenario. In the same way, it is misleading to say that the Hurricanes were 23 points back earlier in the year, because we don’t have a context regarding how many games each team had played.</p>

<p>To eliminate this effect, I’ve mapped the point totals of each team in the conference on this chart based on game number rather than date. A dashed line is included to indicate the number of points required to make the top eight.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.canescast.ca/web/WHLEast20111220.png" alt="Graph showing the accumulation of points by WHL Eastern Conference teams until the Christmas break" title="Graph showing the accumulation of points by WHL Eastern Conference teams until the Christmas break"></p>

<p>You can see that the low point for the Hurricanes was game 22, a 6-2 loss against the Hitmen on November 13. At this point, the Hurricanes were 19 points back of the 22 game playoff pace. At the current end of the graph, we can only go so far as game 35, since the eighth place Hitmen have played only 35 games. At that point, the Hurricanes have now closed the gap to 12 points. It may sound like a trivial difference, but it’s the difference between perceiving a 15 point gain and the actual gain to date of seven points.</p>

<p>As an interesting aside, at game 22 the Red Deer Rebels had the highest point total in the conference (31), while the Hurricanes were the lowest (7). At the 35 game point, the Hurricanes have made up 14 points on the Rebels in 13 games, improving from 24 points back to only a 10 point deficit.</p>

<h2>What does it all mean?</h2>

<p>Between bottoming-out at 19 points back of the pace, and the current (albeit, offset by two games) 12 point deficit, the Hurricanes have gained 7 points over the course of 13 games while playing at a .692 pace. Assuming that pace were to continue for the rest of the season, the Hurricanes could expect to gain about 19 points, which would likely have them finish the regular season in a playoff spot. That makes some assumptions about the level at which the competition will play as well, which is why that dashed line isn&#39;t nice and straight. The Hurricanes do have a two game head-start since they’ve won both games since that 35 game benchmark. It won’t be an easy feat to make up those remaining 12 points, though, and it’ll be a fight right down to the end of the season.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.canescast.ca/article/2011/10/already-out-race">In late October I wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>nothing short of a remarkable turnaround from the Hurricanes will bring WHL playoff hockey back to Lethbridge for 2012</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Hurricanes’ turnaround has been remarkable enough to take them from being written-off early to being in the conversation about the playoff race at the mid-way point. With so much drama already unfolded, it’s hard to believe the season is only halfway complete.</p>
