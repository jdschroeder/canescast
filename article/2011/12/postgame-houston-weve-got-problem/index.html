        <p>With back to back top class goaltending from Liam Liston and Damien Ketlo over the last couple of games, Rich Preston had the difficult choice of which goaltender to start against the Kelowna Rockets for what would be the first of a three game BC road trip.</p>

<p>Liam Liston posted 38 saves to give the Hurricanes their first shutout of the season and a 1-0 win over the Spokane Chiefs in the Hurricanes last game.</p>

<p>This came the night after Damien Ketlo had posted 52 saves on the way to beating the Saskatoon Blades 6-3.</p>

<p>RP went for experience as Damien Ketlo got the nod, but I am sure we will see Liam Liston given the opportunity to show his goal tending prowess over the weekend as the Canes head to Victoria and Vancouver for back-to-back games, Friday/Saturday.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6450320079/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7150/6450320079_14470a553a_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>The Hurricanes held a record of 10-20-0-1 going into tonight&#39;s game, having played 3 more games than the Rockets.</p>

<p>With the Canes winning their last 4 games and chalking up 7 wins in the last 9, the Hurricanes are getting results that Caniacs could only dream of earlier this season.</p>

<p>The Rockets, meanwhile, go into this one holding a record of 11-14-2-1, having won their last 2 games with tonight&#39;s match up being the last of seven game homestand before the Christmas break.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>Both teams were quickly out of the gates in a first period that served up end-to-end action with Lethbridge and Kelowna creating plenty of chances.</p>

<p>After a quiet first 10 minutes with no penalties being called, the Canes got into penalty trouble with Dan Johnston getting called for a trip and soon after Cam Braes getting two for hooking.</p>

<p>With the Canes penalty kill working hard, they forced turnover after turnover breaking up the Rockets power-play. 
However, within the final seconds of the Braes penalty, Kelowna opened the scoring, slotting one past Damien Ketlo from just right of the hash marks, 1-0 Kelowna.</p>

<p>As the Canes took their third penalty in a row with Albin Blomqvist called for cross checking, the Canes looked to be struggling to get something going.</p>

<p>However, the spirit of a tight locker room shone through after great work in the defensive zone forced the turnover and with an inch perfect (behind the back) pass from Nick Buonassisi, Cam Braes finished well to tie it up at 1 goal each.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6293487178/" title="Cam Braes by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6116/6293487178_56a4dd817c_z.jpg" alt="Cam Braes"></a></p>

<p>The Canes went on to sucessfully kill off the remaining penalty time and finished the period with the score even at 1-1, having been outshot 11-9 after 20 minutes.</p>

<p>The second period started in a similar fashion to the first with both sides creating several chances, as the goaltenders were kept busy. </p>

<p>With Macoy Erkamps called for tripping, the Canes found themselves short handed for the fourth time in the game and although they killed off the penalty, Kelowna scored within seconds of Erkamps re-joining the play, giving them the lead for the second time, 2-1.</p>

<p>Canes got their first chance on the power-play with 9:36 left in the second, and although this saw a sustained period of pressure, they struggled to create any clear goal scoring opportunities.</p>

<p>Another soft penalty as Jaimen Yakubowski was called for checking from behind as the Kelowna player lost his edge behind the net. 
The Canes kept true to their task and killed off what was Kelowna&#39;s 5th opportunity of the game with the man advantage. </p>

<p>The second ended with the Rockets leading by one goal, 2-1, having outshot the Canes 19-16.</p>

<p>The Canes were handed a lifeline as Nick Buonassisi struck early in the third to tie it up. 2-2, with 27 seconds gone.</p>

<p>This didn&#39;t last long as the Rockets re-took the lead after sustained pressure on Ketlo&#39;s goal gave a rebound opportunity out front, which McColgan slotted in with the goalie scrambling.</p>

<p>The Canes continued to press as they looked to tie it up for the third time, but lots of possession couldn&#39;t be turned into a goal as the Rockets continued to be strong in defense.</p>

<p>Cam Braes and Nick Bounassisi link up play tested the Kelowna goalender, but Brown was solid and kept the game tight.</p>

<p>Buonassisi had another chance close in, but could only lift it over the net with Brown beaten.</p>

<p>Kelowna doubled their lead mid way through the third, beating Ketlo with a bullet, 4-2. This gave the Canes everything to do if they were going to get anything out of this game.</p>

<p>As the shots stood at 28-21, in Kelowna&#39;s favour with just 5 minutes remaining; Graham Hood had a great chance to beat Brown after Jay Merkley fed him a pass from behind the net, but Brown was equal to the opportunity making a diving save to keep the Rockets ahead, 4-2.</p>

<p>The Hurricanes appeared to be given a lifeline when the Rockets were penalized with a double minor for spearing at the end of the third. 
However, this was cancelled out when Landon Oslanski received a 5-minute major for a hit from behind.</p>

<p>With the remainder of the game to be played 4 on 4, the Canes were left with a mountain to climb.</p>

<p>Rich Preston pulled Damien Ketlo for the extra attacker, but with time running out, it wasn&#39;t enough.</p>

<p>Inevitably, Kelowna scored into the empty net ensuring that the Canes unbeaten run came to and end after 4 games. </p>

<p>The Rockets ran out 5-2 winners with the Hurricanes having been outshot 29-23 in what was a very spirited Lethbridge performance.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>The Rockets were a little more clinical in front of goal and took their opportunities well. 
The Canes showed lots of fight and character, but having already come from behind twice, doing it for a third time, was too much to ask.</p>

<h2><em><a href="http://lethbridgewebdesign.ca">Lethbridge Web Design</a></em> Hardest Working Hurricane: Nick Buonassisi</h2>

<p>Lots of hustle, creating one and scoring another to give the Canes a life line that allowed them to continue to press a more clinical Kelowna side.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>The Canes shouldn&#39;t be too dis-heartened after tonight&#39;s result, they played well and with a little bit of luck could have won this game after having lots of possession with little to show for it.</p>

<p>The Canes look to get back to winning ways as they travel to Vancouver Island to play the Victoria Royals in Victoria on what will be the Royals&#39; Teddy Bear toss night, Friday 9th December. Puck drops at 8:05pm.</p>
