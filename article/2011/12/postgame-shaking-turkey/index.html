        <div class="byline">December 27, 2011 - by Josh Schroeder</div>
        
        <p>Fresh off a brief Christmas break, the Hurricanes opened the unofficial second half of the season Tuesday evening in Cranbrook against the Kootenay Ice. As has been the case several times this season, the Hurricanes iced an incomplete line-up dues to a number of absences. Tyler Kizuik and Max Moline are still sidelined with injuries, Juraj Bezuch is out serving a suspension for the cipping major against Swift Current, and three outstanding rookies – Erkamps, Merkley, and Leverton – are in Windsor, Ontario to compete in the World U17 Hockey Challenge. Harrison Harper received the call-up for his WHL debut, bringing the Hurricanes to 16 skaters, two short of a full line-up.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>The first period was what you might hope for in a road game two days after a Christmas feast. It wasn’t pretty, but the Canes outshot the Ice 10-8 through 20 minutes in a 1-1 game. Kootenay opened the scoring with a quick blast from the high slot by Jagger Dirk, and the Hurricanes evened things up late in the frame when Russ Maxwell forced a turnover and was stopped by Mackenzie Skapski before Jamal Watson shoveled the rebound into the net. Perhaps the more intriguing storyline out of the first was the number of penalties called, as 18 infractions were registered on the gamesheet before the period concluded. Among those penalties were several fighting majors after Jaimen Yakubowski was hit in the neutral zone. Russ Maxwell then delivered a hit that was called for interference and which sparked a fight between Brendan Hurley and Adam Henry. Shortly thereafter Yakubowski dropped the gloves with Levi Cable, earning them each game misconducts for engaging in the second fight while another was taking place. Losing another skater is hardly what the already shorthanded Hurricanes needed.</p>

<p>Kootenay got things rolling early in the second period when Brock Montgomery’s eleventh goal of the season restored the Ice lead. Damien Ketlo did a good job of shutting the door for the remainder of the second period, but Kootenay extended their lead eight minutes into the third on a quick Joe Antilla shot that beat Ketlo between the legs after a Hurricanes turned the puck over. Drew Czerwonka all but sealed it with five minutes to play, driving a slap shot that trickled between Ketlo’s pads and sat in the crease until the Ice captain was able to follow-up and tap in the 4-1 goal. Late in the third the Hurricanes finally capitalized with the man advantage on a good passing play from Oslanski to Hood to Sutter who scored from a tight angle to close out the scoring in a 4-2 loss.</p>

<p>It was a night of missed chances for the Hurricanes, going 1/9 on the powerplay and missing the net entirely on two breakaway opportunities. The 4-2 score belies what was actually a pretty sloppy peformance by both teams that could have gone either way. In the end, it was Kootenay who were able to capitalize on their chances and pull out a win.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>...why the Hurricanes lost: An abyssmal powerplay took its toll. Ranked 18th through the first half of the season with a sub-standard 17.4% conversion rate, the Hurricanes’ powerplay again failed to pay dividends despite having nine opportunities on the man advantage. The one powerplay tally they did muster came with 19 seconds left in the third and the game already out of reach. For far too much of their time on the powerplay tonight, the Canes looked lost and unable to establish any possession in the attacking zone. To compete with the league’s elite, they will need to capitalize more frequently with the man advantage.</p>

<p>Russ Maxwell gets the honour this evening. His forechecking was strong tonight, creating a few turnovers and driving some scoring opportunities. Maxwell also stirred up some of the rough stuff, including the fracas that got Jaimen Yakubowski and Levi Cable ejected from the game.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>On a positive note, the Hurricanes’ penalty kill was a perfect 6/6 tonight. Undoubtedly Coach Preston would like to see his team taking fewer than 42 minutes worth of infractions, though. This team can’t afford to let their discipline slip now lest they fall into a second half slide reminiscent of last season. Let’s hope the rust has been shaken off after this one and that the Hurricanes can return to their winning ways.</p>

<p>Next up is a home and home with the rival Medicine Hat Tigers beginning on Thursday night, 7:00 at the Enmax Centre. Get your tickets by calling (403)329-SEAT.</p>
