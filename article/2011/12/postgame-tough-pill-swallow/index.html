        <p>In the second game of the unofficial second half of the 2011/12 WHL season, the Canes returned to the Enmax looking to continue were they left off before the break and extend their winning record at home.</p>

<p>The Canes posted an impressive 9-1 in their last 10 home games, losing once to the Oil kings, having won the last 6 games at the Enmax centre.</p>

<p>Players looking to extend their hot streaks include; Nick Buonassisi who has 23 points in his last 20 games, Brody Sutter notching 13 in his last 10 and Russell Maxwell with 9 points in his last 6 games.</p>

<p>The Canes are unbeaten against the Tigers so far this season having beaten them twice, both games being played back in the Hatters backyard. This was the Tigers first visit to the Lethbridge this season as they looked to avenge the losses of 4-2 and 4-3, the first being the Tabbies season opener at the Medicine Hat Arena.</p>

<p>No love is lost between these two local rivals and the game was expected to be physical as these contests are always hard fought affairs, not one for the faint hearted.</p>

<p>Could the Canes make it 3 wins in a row over their local rival, unfortunately not in what was a highly penalized game that seemed to run away from the officials somewhat.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>The game started brightly as both teams came out of the blocks quickly. With nothing to really separate either team until Brady Ramsay took a great cross ice feed from Cam Braes to give the Canes the lead with 4:49 gone, 1-0. 
With that assist, Cam Braes registered his 100th WHL career assist, a statistic that was warmly received by the Enmax faithful.</p>

<p>The Tigers tied it up as they hacked away at Damien Ketlo for an age before Trevor Cox forced the puck lose and into the net, 1-1.</p>

<p>The Medicine Hat go ahead goal exposed a defensive breakdown for the Hurricanes after Ketlo was drawn out of his crease and with no one marking the back post, Kessey had no problem shoving home the lose puck to double their lead, with the Canes now trailing by a goal, 2-1.</p>

<p>The Canes first opportunity with the man advantage allowed them to create a couple of decent shots, of note was Albin Blomqvist&#39;s big slap shot - but without really opening the Tigers defence their struggles on the power play continued.</p>

<p>The second started with the Canes having to kill the penalty Spencer Galbraith took late in the first, and did a fine job blocking shots and getting bodies in front of the puck.</p>

<p>With the penalty over, the Canes starting to exert some pressure and got a couple of shots on the Tigers goal, but Bunz showed his class and was equal to whatever the Hurricanes could throw at the net.
Damien Ketlo, at the other end, showed he was no slouch in the Lethbridge net as he made save after save to keep the Hurricanes in it when they were exposed at the back.</p>

<p>Ex-hurricane Alex Theriau had a lively game and was denied a great opportunity when Brody Sutter dived headlong in front of his shot.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6598495705/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7171/6598495705_5fbf0debaf_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>After a period of play that had decent chances for both teams, former teammates Alex Theriau and Cam Braes got into some fisticuffs.</p>

<p>It was Captain Cam who showed he was the boss in these parts as he landed several big left handers to ensure Theriau left Lethbridge with a couple more &#39;fond&#39; memories.</p>

<p>With seconds left to play in the second, a prospective shot from the boards gives the tigers a 2 goal lead as it took a wicked deflection off a canes stick and rattled in off the cross bar and the left upright. Canes now trailed by 2 goals, 3-1.</p>

<p>A late Daniel Johnston interference penalty, seconds after the goal, meant the Canes would again start a period short handed as they looked to get back into this one.</p>

<p>The third started with the Canes having a couple of chances shorthanded, but their lack of finishing in front of goal was proving costly.
The Canes got called for too many men on the ice penalty 37 seconds in, a curious call as the officials missed the Tigers having 8 players in contact with the ice during the first and were not penalized.
5 on 3 proved to be too much for the Canes as the Tigers extended their lead, 4-1, scooping one past Ketlo from close in as the 2 extra men proved decisive.</p>

<p>More penalty trouble was to follow for the Hurricanes as the officials continued to see this game in a very different light to the 3000 + fans that filled the Enmax, which included a good number of Medicine Hat fans who had made the journey west for this local match up.
Medicine Hat scored another on the power play after Oslanski was called for holding, a call that was hotly contested.</p>

<p>Trailing 5-1, this seemed to be a lost cause, but the Canes continued to press and hustle to get back into this game. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6598495439/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6598495439_a561d51ce4_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>Sam McKechnie restored a little bit of pride back for the Hurricanes as he made it 5-2 after sustained pressure with the Canes battling hard to get back into this game. Assists on McK&#39;s goal went to Landon Oslanski, with Cam Braes notching up number 101.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it was not enough to save the Hurricanes. </p>

<p>The game finished with more heated words as the Canes ran out with a 5-2 loss having been outshot 36-26.</p>

<p>Another game were the officials made several questionable calls, which more than affected the outcome of this matchup.
In a game were many penalties were &#39;missed&#39;, there were several poor or weak calls made which left the Canes looking for answers when down by a man or more. These included 3, 10-minute misconducts in the last 8 minutes. Consistency by the officials would have made this a fairer match up, but with how this was called, it was always going to be an up-hill battle.
Canes went 0/3 on the power play whilst the Tigers went 2/9.</p>

<p>Interesting WHL factoid: Tyler Bunz would have tallied 1,000 WHL saves if he had kept out the 2 goals the Hurricanes had scored. He will no doubt surpass that milestone tomorrow night if selected.</p>

<h2>One good reason ... why the canes lost</h2>

<p>We have said this previously, but the Canes have to play 60 minutes, especially at the back as defensive lapses left them struggling to get a result tonight.</p>

<p>They were certainly not helped by the officiating which gave the tigers 9 opportunities with at least one man advantage over the Hurricanes in what really shouldn&#39;t have been a penalty ridden game for either side from the CanesCast vantage point. </p>

<h2><em><a href="http://lethbridgewebdesign.ca">Lethbridge Web Design</a></em> Hardest Working Hurricane: Brody Sutter</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6598496639/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7156/6598496639_400a26d349_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>Hitting hard, forcing the play and putting his body on the line time after time. Brody stepped up again and played as hard defensively as he did in the offensive zone.</p>

<p>Close contender was Cam Braes who notched 2 assists and a fight in a night when things wouldn&#39;t go in the Canes favor.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>Canes need to dig deep to restore the character and fight that gave them much success prior to the festive break and get back to winning ways. The Canes were not &#39;bad&#39; tonight, but they do need to stay disciplined at the back and not be left puck watching if they are to continue on their road to recovery.</p>

<p>Both teams are back at it Friday night as the Hurricanes travel to the Hat for the back-to-back rematch, puck drops at 7:30pm.</p>
