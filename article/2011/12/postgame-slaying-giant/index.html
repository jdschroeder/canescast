        <p>How about a trivia question? How many players have captained the Lethbridge Hurricanes since they last beat the Vancouver Giants? Would you believe six? Brent Seabrook was captain last time the ‘Canes beat the Giants (although he was playing for Team Canada at the World Juniors when the game took place, so Mark Ashton was wearing the ‘C’ on that night). Ashton, Kris Hogg, Ben Wright, Carter Bancks, and Mike Reddington have served as captains since that win in Vancouver on December 28, 2004. Could this year’s team led by Cam Braes put an end to a seven year losing streak?</p>

<p>The Hurricanes come into the game having suffered losses in each of their first two games on a three game BC Division swing. The Giants come in having beaten the high-flying Portland Winter Hawks on Friday night in Vancouver’s teddy bear toss game. The Giants come into this game without head coach Don Hay and leading scorer Brendan Gallagher, both of whom are off to Calgary for Canada’s World Junior camp.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>Looking to erase the memory of a third period collapse in Victoria the night before, the Hurricanes came out hard against the Giants and quickly put the home team on their heels. Graham Hood fed Brody Sutter on a two-on-one that glanced off the crossbar, and minutes later Dan Johnston delivered a big hit on Eric Walker at center ice. Some great chances followed from Nick Buonassisi, Cam Braes, and Jamal Watson, but Vancouver goalie Adam Morrison shut the door to keep the game scoreless. That’s how the score would remain until just over two minutes remaining in the period when Cain Franson’s wraparound attempt went through the crease to Taylor Makin who shovelled the puck past Damien Ketlo to give the Giants a 1-0 lead. It didn’t take a minute until the Hurricanes replied on the powerplay when a miscommunication between Morrison and Neil Manning gave Buonassisi an opening to puck the puck loose to Braes at the top of the crease for an easy tap-in.</p>

<p>Vancouver came out strong in the second period, but it was the line of Russ Maxwell, Jaimen Yakubowski, and Sam Mckechnie who made things happen. Yakubowski was stopped by Morrison on a two-on-one and then a short while later getting a step on the Vancouver defence to draw a penalty shot. With a textbook delivery on the penalty shot, faking backhand and then roofing the puck on the forehand, Yakubowski put the Hurricanes up 2-1. Two minutes later Yakubowski added his second of the game, tipping in a centering pass from Russ Maxwell to open up a 3-1 lead. James Henry got the Giants back to within one on the powerplay, walking in and snapping a shot high stick side to make it 3-2.</p>

<p>The Giants put the pressure on in the third period, hemming the Hurricanes into their zone for stretches. The Hurricanes responded by keeping the chances mostly to the outside and clearing rebounds, keeping life from getting too hectic for Damien Ketlo. Graham Hood was penalized for hooking in the final minute, but ten seconds into the penalty kill Russ Maxwell iced the game with an empty net goal from his own blue line, giving the Hurricanes a 4-2 victory.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>... why the Hurricanes won. Quite frankly, they were the better team tonight. This wasn&#39;t the push back that I expected to see from the Giants, and the Hurricanes earned the road victory by getting a lead and successfully defending it.</p>

<p>Russ Maxwell edges out linemate Jaimen Yakubowski tonight. Maxwell did a nice job as the set-up man tonight, putting together several good scoring opportunities, most notably a nice feed from the right wall to the top of the crease where Yakubowski tipped home the eventual game winner.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>The Hurricanes wind-up their three game BC road trip on a high note after dropping a couple of winnable games in Kelowna and Victoria. More than just two points, this win gets a monkey off the Hurricanes’ back by beating Vancouver for the first time in seven years.</p>

<p>Only three games remain for the Hurricanes before the Christmas break, and they all happen at the Enmax Centre in a span of four nights this week. First up are the Calgary Hitmen on Wednesday at 7:00. Get your tickets by calling (403)329-SEAT.</p>
