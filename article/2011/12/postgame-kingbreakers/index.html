        <p>After a game earlier in the month where the Hurricanes led the Royals going into the third and a close call December 14 where another lead slipped away but they managed to get the last minute tie and the quick win in OT against the Hitmen; the Canes were looking to show a more consistent effort and continue to puts some numbers in the W column. The Royals are coming off 2 defeats since beating the Canes and are looking to get some momentum as we approach the holiday break.</p>

<p>The game tonight against the Royals marks the second game in 3 nights and sets the Canes up for the Annual Teddy Bear Toss where they will take on the Bronco&#39;s on Saturday night.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>The game started with the Hurricanes coming out flying. Leading in shots quickly Galbraith got the puck to Tot in behind the net who put the backhand pass right onto the stick of Brody Sutter in the slot who slammed it behind Hamilton to put the Canes up 1 nothing.<br>
The Royals picked up the play and started evening up the shots after the goal. Ramsay too a penalty for slashing at 9:25, but the Canes showed some of the defensive posture they have evidenced at times and kept things even. Tot put the Canes up 2 - 0 in the 19th minute as the line of Tot, Hood and Sutter kept the pressure on the Royals through the first. Some shenanigans after the buzzer led to Ramsay going off again for slashing and the Canes Starting the 2nd period short handed.</p>

<p>Hamilton was pulled in favour of Rathjen to start the second periiod.</p>

<p>Buonassisi was sent for hooking at 4:20 of the second, but some aggressive penalty killing led to the Canes getting the puck into the Royals zone where Sundher took a Slashing call leading to some 4 on 4 and a brief Canes power play. Hood is able to pounce on the rebound on Johnston&#39;s point shot, and the Canes take the lead 3 - 0 at 7:03 on the Sundher power play. Blomqvist gets caught flat-footed and ends up being sent for holding. Pauls is able to put the Royals on the board as the screened shot is deflected past Ketlo. </p>

<p>The balance of the second showed a steady parade to the penalty box as we ended up with a Fight between Blomqvist and Carrol. Blomqvist showed his fighting prowess handily as Carrol was not able to mount any serious defense. Nelson and Oslanski looked to try their luck shortly after, but the refs broke that up quickly and showed no tolerance for any more fisticuffs, sending both away for 10 minute misconducts.</p>

<p>Canes still held the lead though the shots advantage had dried up towards the end of the second as the Canes defensive play was becoming overwhelmed by the Royals offense; forcing Ketlo to stay strong in net.</p>

<p>The third saw a flurry of Victoria goals as the Canes could not seem to control the game as they had through the first period and a half. By the 7th minute the Royals had put three past Ketlo on goals from Walker, Pauls and Crooks and it started to look like de javu all over again as the Canes lead in the third evaporated. Johnston brought the Canes back in to it just 14 seconds after Crooks goal. Neither team could take the advantage on strong goaltending from both sides and the Canes looked again into the face of OT. </p>

<p>The Canes again showed emotion in OT. Strong forechecking led to Ramsay catching the puck at the side of the net, and lifting it past Rathjen through the tiniest of cracks between post and goaltender, Ramsay was able to give the Hurricanes the win at 1:22 of OT as the sigh of relief in the arena was palpable (even over the roar of approval). </p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>The Canes won based on strong leadership from the Sutter, Tot and Hood line. The solid defensive play the team showed through most of the game...evaporated late in the second and  up to midway through the third as they found themselves giving up chances to the Royals. Settling down and maintaining some composure allowed them to regroup after losing the lead; giving themselves another chance, and another OT win.</p>

<h2><em><a href="http://lethbridgewebdesign.ca">Lethbridge Web Design</a></em> Hardest Working Hurricane Brody Sutter</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6524061011/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7008/6524061011_250da0730d_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>Sutter, Tot and Hood were all outstanding in their; but the nod went to Brody Sutter. Sutter netted a goal and an assist and seemed to generate chances everytime he touched he puck.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>The Canes are improving at keeping the puck off their goaltenders, but the shots total again ended with opposing side over 40 shots and the Canes trailing by almost 20 (totals of 44 - 28). The Canes will need to see what they can do to keep the play off the goaltenders.</p>

<p>The Canes next game will be their Annual Teddy Bear Toss against the Bronco&#39;s Coming off 2 overtime wins the Canes will need to show heart and consistency to beat the Swift Current Bronco&#39;s as they are coming off their recent loss to Kootney Ice.</p>
