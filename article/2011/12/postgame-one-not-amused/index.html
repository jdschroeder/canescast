<p>Travelling offshore to Vancouver Island, the Hurricanes face the newest WHL franchise, the Victoria Royals.
Created when the Chilliwack Bruins were sold at the end of last season, the new owners moved the franchise over to the Island and Victoria got the WHL franchise they dearly wanted and had waited several years to arrive.</p>

<p>Liam Liston got the start in goal for the Hurricanes, as they will play 2 games in 2 nights, travelling to Vancouver on Saturday night to face the Giants as they round out their 3 game road trip.</p>

<p>Going into this match up, the Victoria Royals have racked up a record of 12-17-1-1 in their first season in the Western Conference of the WHL.</p>

<p>With Cam Braes looking to extend his goal-scoring streak to 8, the Hurricanes arrive in Victoria with a record of 10-21-0-1.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>The Hurricanes started this game with a jump and dictated most of the play for the first period.</p>

<p>Creating lots of chances from the off, the Canes looked to have taken the lead when Jaimen Yakubowski appeared to have scored, as the crowd and the press box thought he hit the back of the net. But, with no call and no review from the officials, the game continued scoreless.
Soon after, the game hotted up as Tyler Kizuik got smoked at centre ice; thankfully he was able to regain his composure and skated to the bench to rejoin the action a little while later.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6293498204/" title="Juraj Bezuch by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6114/6293498204_3513c1e8eb_z.jpg" alt="Juraj Bezuch"></a></p>

<p>With the game being dominated by the Hurricanes, they took the lead when Juraj Bezuch scored with the wrister in close to beat Hamilton blocker side after great work from Adam Henry and Jay Merkley, 1-0 Hurricanes.</p>

<p>Jamal Watson broke in on the Royals goal creating several chance and looks livelier with every game.
With nice stick handling Brody Sutter opened up some space and fed Jamal Watson on the doorstep, but he couldn&#39;t beat Hamilton who was down quick as Jamal banged away.</p>

<p>Notable mentions to Macoy Erkamps, Brady Ramsay and Russell Maxwell who all came close forcing several saves but unable to extend the Canes&#39; lead.
Russell Maxwell in particular was having another strong game as he combined well on a line with Jaimen Yakubowski and Sam McKechnie, </p>

<p>It was Jaimen Yakubowski who got his just desserts, scoring with the tip in after Daniel Johnston fired a rocket on goal, 2-0 Canes.</p>

<p>With what was a rare Royals&#39; attack at that point; Liam Liston was beaten from the high slot triggering the start of the teddy bear toss with 1:49 left in the first. 
The officials decided to tag the remaining time onto the start of the second period to minimize the delay re-starting play as the arena staff cleared the teddy bears from the ice.</p>

<p>Period &#39;ended&#39; with the Canes leading 2-1 having outshot Victoria, 14-6 in a period that was all Lethbridge.</p>

<p>As the game restarted after the break, the Royals tied it up early with the Canes looking to have left their game back in the locker room.</p>

<p>Soon after, Victoria scored their 3rd un-answered goal on the power play after Daniel Johnston was serving 2 for a trip.</p>

<p>Things got serious fast and the Canes needed to concentrate at the task at hand after seeming to take their foot off the gas as they were cruising in the first.</p>

<p>Johnston gets called again for tripping and things looked to be going from bad to worse, but this Canes team have shown on many games recently they have character and they didn&#39;t go missing this time.
After forcing the turnover, Brady Ramsay short handed ties it up for the Canes and they were all level at 3-3.</p>

<p>But this game was far from over and after the Royals got called for Hooking, Jay Merkley powered the Canes back in front seconds into the power play, 4-3. The assists coming to Cam Braes and Macoy Erkamps</p>

<p>As the game re-started, the defence was still celebrating and the Royals were allowed to skate un challenged into the Canes blue zone and tie it up, 4-4.
Not at all what the Canes were hoping for after having re-taken the lead, as they had to start all over again.</p>

<p>The Canes were back on front after good work by Brody Sutter in front of the goalie as he got a tip on the prospective shot from Graham Hood to give the Canes the lead once more with 6 minutes left in the second, 5-4. 
The other assist on the go ahead goal going to Jamal Watson.</p>

<p>The Canes had their chances to go further in front as Adam Henry and Jay Merkley combined well, but with Hamilton covered his posts, the Canes were kept from extending their lead.</p>

<p>Kevin Sundher had his seconded short handed chance of the game and the opportunity to tie things up for the Royals, but Liam Liston who has a good record one on one, denied him for the second time and kept it 5-4 Hurricanes.</p>

<p>The Royals looked to have tied it up at the end of the second on the power play, however Liam Liston got enough on the shot, that the puck crossed the line 0.2 seconds after the period expired.</p>

<p>Lethbridge had dodged a bullet going in leading by a goal with the score at 5-4 having outshot the Royals 25-17.</p>

<p>Both goal tenders will have gone in not too happy after shipping 3 and 2 goals respectively having both faced 10 shots each during the second period.</p>

<p>The third started with the Canes one goal to the good 5-4, as they needed a repeat of their play during the first period. </p>

<p>However, this was a different game as the Royals on the tic-tac-toe tie things up once more. 
A very pretty goal, but the Canes defence will be asking who was covering the player at the far post as he scored un-challenged to make it 5-5.</p>

<p>Right off the face-off Royals took the lead as the Canes quite frankly fell asleep at the back. 6-5 Royals with the Canes looking to have left the building.</p>

<p>Focus and concentration was the order of the day and after several defensive lapses, the Canes would have to dig deep to get back into this one.</p>

<p>The Royals made it 7-5 scoring their 3rd within 4 minutes of the restart to reverse the 5-4 lead the Canes held at the start of the third.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6293671650/" title="Braes, Sutter, and Henry by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6031/6293671650_509ece29a0_z.jpg" alt="Braes, Sutter, and Henry"></a></p>

<p>As the bell tolled in the Arena, Damien Ketlo replaced Liam Liston to try to stop the rot.</p>

<p>Short handed the Royals broke and as Steven Hodges was taken down on his way through on goal, a penalty shot was awarded to the Royals.</p>

<p>As Hodges scored Victoria&#39;s 8th of the game and their 4th in the third, beating Kelto with the deke to the backhand putting it high on the blocker side, the Canes night was effectively over.</p>

<p>Braes and Watson had a couple of good chances later on, but Hamilton was equal to their effort and there was no way back in this one for the Canes.</p>

<p>The game ended with the Hurricanes having lost this one 8-5 after having gone into the 3rd leading 5-4. Canes outshooting the Royals 31-26.</p>

<h2>One good reason ... why the canes lost</h2>

<p>Poor defence as they switched off to let the Royals back into this, simply they just stopped playing.
60 minutes of play was never more appropriate as it was tonight. </p>

<h2><em><a href="http://lethbridgewebdesign.ca">Lethbridge Web Design</a></em> Hardest Working Hurricane: Jay Merkley</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6293539651/" title="Jay Merkley by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6101/6293539651_319846cb71_z.jpg" alt="Jay Merkley"></a></p>

<p>Always hustling and working hard trying to get things going with a goal and an assist, but with all his effort couldn&#39;t move the mountains required to get the Canes back to winning ways.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>Poor defence, a lack of concentration and a third period that saw the Royals overturn a one goal deficit to score 4, 3 of which in 3:05, to take this game away from the Canes after the Canes had been the better side for most of the game.</p>

<p>The Canes finish their BC road trip tomorrow night against the Vancouver Giants. Puck drops at 8:00pm.</p>
