        The Canes sported their Military appreciation jersey, adorned with a gold ribbon and camouflage to pay respects to those who battle overseas to fight for our freedom.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6336592766/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6219/6336592766_a0b1ca5b2f_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>After the joy of last Wednesday&#39;s shoot out win against the the Everett Silvertips, the Canes returned to the Enmax on the back of a two game losing streak whilst on the road in Saskatchewan.
Being able to dress 7 defencemen for the first time in about a dozen games, gave the Canes a new lease of life after struggling defensively for most of the season.
This was a game that the fans at the Enmax hoped would extend the Canes&#39; win count with their current record standing at 3-15-0-1.</p>

<p>Seattle&#39;s only visit of the year to Lethbridge sees them arriving in a similar position to the Canes at the bottom of the divisional standings with a 5-10-0-0 record, having lost their last 5 games home and away.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<h1>1st Period</h1>

<p>In a relatively even matched first period the Canes pressed hard and showed some clever play linking up well as they started to show what they can do with a full roster of players.
The Canes skated hard, and with some slick passing opened up the Thunderbirds on several occasions, Nick Buonassisi, Graham Hood, Brody Sutter and Philip Tot all had great chances to break the deadlock, but couldn&#39;t beat Pickard in the first 20 minutes.
The Canes looked a lot more assured at the back as their defence organized themselves well taking their lead from veteran goaltender, Damien Ketlo who showed his experience in goal, getting down well to save several well crafted Seattle openings.
The Canes finished the first leading on the shot clock 11-10.</p>

<h1>2nd Period</h1>

<p>Canes picked it up early in the second and after putting lots of pressure on the Thunderbirds, Oslanski fired a rocket into the top corner to give the Canes the lead, 1-0.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6335851993/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6116/6335851993_88dbc0fb9e_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>However, seconds later with the goal still being announced, the defence let Seattle back in as they evened it up, beating Ketlo low at the far post, 1-1.
The Canes thought they had taken the lead when Brady Ramsay cleaned up at the far post after forcing a scramble in front with the wrap around, however after the officials reviewed it, the puck had been turned around the post - no goal.
No stranger to the penalty box whilst he played for the Hurricanes, Cason Machacek, got into some fisty cuffs with Craig Leverton, with the rookie more than holding his own against a guy who always liked to fight when he was north of the border. 
Funnily enough, a creature of habit and much to the amusement of the home fans, Cason made his way to the Canes penalty bench instead of the visitors when he was called for fighting.
The second finished with a goal mouth scramble which had the Caniacs in the building groaning as Captain Cam Braes couldn&#39;t quite force it past T-Birds goaltender, Pickard.
As good a 20 minutes of hockey as the Canes have had this season as they outshot Seattle 14-10 over the course of the second period. 
The period ended with the score even, 1-1 after the Canes had several chances to take the lead, but couldn&#39;t capitalize on anything out front.</p>

<h1>3rd Period.</h1>

<p>The third continued in the same vein as the second period as the Canes continued to have lots of possession and created many chances, but were unable to force it home as the Seattle defence covered superbly for their goaltender cleaning up anything that came close to troubling Pickard.
All this was quickly un-done in a wicked turn of events as the t-birds caught Ketlo wandering too far from his crease as the puck took a lucky bounce behind the net with Elliot forcing it home to give Seattle their first lead of the game, 1-2.
The Canes battled back, throwing everything into it, but still couldn&#39;t make their pressure pay.
Things turn from bad to worse as with less than 2 minutes left to play, the defence didn&#39;t pick up Noebels at the far post as he got the one timer away to give the t-birds the lead, 1-3.
Not to be outdone, Adam Henry with his first WHL goal, cleaned up 10 seconds later after a scramble out in front, to give the Canes a fighting chance, 2-3 with 1:48 left in the game.
In the dying minutes and with the bit between their teeth, Rich Preston pulled Kelto for the extra attacker, but the Canes couldn&#39;t make it count as they ran this one out losing by a goal 2-3 having outshot the Thunderbirds, 35-28.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>Without a player charging the net and forcing the play out front, the Canes struggle to turn possession into goals, even when registering 35 shots over the course of the game. Defensively they have really tightened up, but need to make the turnovers count on the rush to get back to winning ways.</p>

<p>Macoy Erkamps, who showed that even with the return of several defencemen, justified his ice time playing hard defensively whilst crafting several chances at the other end. As Macoy gains experience he will prove to be an integral part of this Hurricanes team as they start to turn things around over the next few months.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>A tough loss for the Hurricanes as they kept their opponents under 30 shots for the first time in a long while. Lots of pressure and good play, but they couldn&#39;t make it count where it mattered most, in front of the net.
Another game full of promise where the Canes battled hard but just fell short when on another night, they could have won this comfortably. </p>

<h2>Next up</h2>

<p>The Hurricanes take on the Tri-City Americans back at the Enmax on Saturday, November 12th. Puck drops at 7:00pm.</p>
