        <p>It was a terrifying month of October for the Lethbridge Hurricanes, capped off with a 5-0 loss to the Red Deer Rebels on Saturday. Thirteen losses and an 0-12-0-1 record in the month of October have the Hurricanes anxious for a fresh start and some positive results as the calendar turns over on a new month.</p>

<p>The conditions were prime for a win tonight against the Everett Silvertips who came into the seventh game of a long nine game road trip with a 4-11-0-2 record. The &#39;Tips struggled to a 10-2 loss in Medicine Hat last night, while the Hurricanes were able to enjoy three days off since their last game on Saturday night.</p>

<p>It was a case of two desperate teams both hoping to turn their fortunes against a struggling opposition.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>The Hurricanes got a quick edge in shots, although the chances weren&#39;t particularly dangerous. The early highlight, though, was Cam Braes taking on former Hurricane defenceman Brennan Yadlowski in a spirited scrap off of a face-off. Braes delivered a flurry and managed to get Yadlowski&#39;s jersey over his head to earn a pretty clear decision. Despite some promise from the Hurricanes, it was Everett who opened the scoring with a powerplay goal, and then extended their lead seconds later after some defensive confusion on the rush. Nick Buonassisi rang one off the inside of the post before the period was out, but that&#39;s as close as the Hurricanes would come.</p>

<p>Early in the second Brady Ramsay was stopped on a clear cut breakaway when he was just unable to stuff a backhander past the skate of Everett goalie Kent Simpson. A short while later Macoy Erkamps got caught hooking Josh Birkholz on a breakaway of his own, and Birkholz used the resulting penalty shot to give the Silvertips a 3-0 lead. Ramsay kept leading the way for the Hurricanes, though, and managed to shovel the Canes&#39; first goal past Simpson on a wild scramble in front.</p>

<p>The rough stuff started to flare up in the middle of the period when Jordyn Boyd went low with a hit on Russ Maxwell, immediately drawing the attention of Graham Hood who let fists fly on him. Boyd was assessed a major and game misconduct for clipping on the play. On the ensuing powerplay the Hurricanes managed to strike twice, once when Ramsay picked the top corner while Maxwell provided a screen, and then with a big Landon Oslanski slap shot from the point to tie it up at three. A little more rough stuff went down before the conclusion of the period when Tyler Kizuik responded quickly to Jesse Mychan slashing Liam Liston. Kizuik slammed him hard into the end boards and the two exchanged punches.</p>

<p>Several chances both ways during the third period with Buonassisi, Ramsay, and Bezuch at the centre of most of them for the Hurricanes. In fact, Bezuch&#39;s continued strong play earned him a spot on the top line with Braes and Sutter for the third period. The goals dried up in the third period, earning each team a point and sending the game to overtime.</p>

<p>The first half of overtime was spent almost entirely in Lethbridge territory and resulted in a few near misses for the Silvertips. After that the play settled down a bit and neither team was able to muster a serious scoring chance, bringing the game, and perhaps the losing streak, to a climax of ultimate suspense: the shootout.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6307776993/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6035/6307776993_3106cea353.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>The first shot of the shootout had Bezuch make a massive deke to send Simpson diving into next week. The Silvertips argued that Bezuch had moved backward at the end of his deke, and after a review the goal was indeed rescinded. Tyler Maxwell shot first for Everett, zig-zagging and shooting wide. Sutter shot next the Hurricanes, but lost control as he put on his deke. The other way Liston kept the left pad down to stymie Birkholz&#39;s deke, keeping things even headed to the third shots. Cam Braes went five hole leaving no doubt and giving the Canes the lead. Ryan Harrison, up next for Everett, over-handled the puck, giving the Canes the dramatic comeback victory.</p>

<p>It was a welcome scene after the game as the Hurricane players congratulated each other on the hard fought win and saluted the boisterous fans who were celebrating along with them.</p>

<p>In the end, the shots favoured Everett 41-37, once again an indictment of the Hurricanes&#39; play in their own zone for much of the night.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>... why the Hurricanes won: They wanted it badly enough. Even down 3-0 in the second period, the Hurricanes didn&#39;t roll over in this game. We saw some great individual performances from, among others, Ramsay, Erkamps, Buonassisi, Oslanski, and Liston. Unlike some previous games where the Hurricanes looked good early and seemed to have a chance at winning only to fall apart as the game progressed, Lethbridge played to the end tonight and deserved the victory.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6307787129/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6225/6307787129_51ec9be2dd.jpg" width="500" height="413" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>An easy pick for us tonight, as Brady Ramsay put up a two goal performance and could have had a couple more. Where the Hurricanes had chances, he was often at the centre of it.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>That win lets the Hurricanes put October in the rear view mirror and start November off right. It also finally puts an end to the longest losing streak in team history. It wasn&#39;t, however, the most convincing of victories against one of the weaker opponents the Hurricanes will face. This win alone won&#39;t get people talking about all of a sudden being able to push for the playoffs, but hopefully it can inspire some more confidence in the team and start a new trend of winning.</p>

<p>The Hurricanes will now take a brief road trip out to Saskatchewan for the weekend, taking on the Prince Albert Raiders on Friday night. At 4-13-1-1 to start the year, the Raiders should provide an opportunity for the &#39;Canes to string a couple of wins together.
