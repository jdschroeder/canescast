        <h1>Postgame: Identity</h1>
        <div class="byline">November 18, 2011 - by Josh Schroeder</div>
        
        <p>This one didn&#39;t look good on paper: The Hurricanes on a five game losing streak, losers of of 18 games since the beginning of October; The Rebels atop the WHL&#39;s central division; Red Deer having beaten Lethbridge 4-1 and 5-0 in their previous meetings this season. On the surface, this one looked like an easy one for the Rebels.</p>

<p>The Hurricanes had other plans, looking to establish an identity and turn their fortunes around.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6255852993/"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6054/6255852993_0047308dc5.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>Dan Johnston set the tone early, levelling Rebels Adam Kambeitz as he crossed the Hurricanes&#39; blue line. The physical play continued with some big hits by Graham Hood, Brody Sutter, Tyler Kizuik and Spencer Galbraith. The physical jump translated into some good forechecking and scoring opportunities, but Patrik Bartosak kept the Hurricanes at bay. That was until 13 minutes into the period when Phil Tot fired a shot toward the goal from deep in the corner, banking it off of Bartosak and into the net to give the Hurricanes a lead.</p>

<p>The second period carried on much like the first, and Jamal Watson doubled the lead when Jay Merkley fed him a pass at the top of the crease. Watson chipped the puck past Bartosak to tally his first Western Hockey League goal. Late in the period during a delayed penalty, Russ Maxwell slid one past the Rebels goalkeeper to open up a 3-0 lead.</p>

<p>The Rebels began with some push back in the third period, but were held off the board until 13 minutes into the period when Matt Dumba held the puck in the zone and fired a shot that Kambeitz deflected past Damien Ketlo. Bartosak headed for the bench with under two minutes to play and it paid dividends when Kambeitz struck again, lifting a backhander into the top corner to make it a one goal game. The Hurricanes&#39; lead nearly stood up, but Kambeitz completed the hat trick with a buzzer beater that went to video review before being confirmed.</p>

<p>Overtime solved nothing, although both teams had chances, the best coming when Kambeitz found himself with a chance all alone in front of the net. Ketlo closed down the angle on him and made a game saving stop.</p>

<p>The shootout was highlighted by Juraj Bezuch&#39;s signature soft hands, deking Bartosak cleanly to score the first goal of the shootout. It took ten shooters to finally decide a winner, and the difference was Tot scoring on a quick snap shot.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>... why the Hurricanes won. They set the tone physically and managed to do so without taking unnecessary penalties. The Rebels enjoyed only two powerplays all evening, and the Hurricanes&#39; aggressive play resulted in more effective own-zone play, as well as successful forechecking.</p>

<p>We like the guy who established the Hurricanes&#39; physical play early in the first period: Dan Johnston. Johnston also moved the puck well and got involved in the attack. It was probably his best game of the season, and he was also recognized as the game&#39;s second star.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>The common theme in the post game interviews was that the team came into this contest looking to establish their identity. As we&#39;ve seen in the last two games, the Hurricanes are most successful when they drive the game physically. They&#39;ve played right there with two of the best teams in the WHL so long as they&#39;ve stuck to that style and kept the rest of their game simple. When they get away from that style and try to get too fancy with the puck, that&#39;s when things start to fall apart.</p>

<p>This identity is sure to be tested in the coming weeks. Before the month is out, the Hurricanes will face the Rebels twice more, as well as three games against the Edmonton Oil Kings and one against the Medicine Hat Tigers. The first of those tests comes Saturday night when the Hurricanes host the Oil Kings, 7:00 at the Enmax Centre.</p>
