        <p>Okay, so maybe it won&#39;t be terribly spooky, since I haven&#39;t gone through the costume contest photos yet, but we&#39;ve got a jack-o-lantern and a 13 game losing streak. That sounds spooky enough for me.</p>

<p>I spent some time on Saturday afternoon carving pumpkins with my family. This was my result.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start off our action with the Hurricanes and Blazers from back on the 21st. Mark looked after photo duties on this night.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6268126497/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6156/6268126497_caaa8d0ea1.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by canescast, on Flickr"></a></p>

<p>He&#39;s going to have to do something about that yellow mask.</p>

<p>Brody Sutter and Nick Buonassisi celebrate a goal here. This was Buonassisi&#39;s first game with the Hurricanes.</p>

<p>In the second period it looked like the Hurricanes could win this game, coming back from an early 2-0 deficit to take a 4-3 lead. A flurry by the Blazers late in the period snuffed out that attempt, and the Canes fell 7-4.</p>

<p>Saturday was the much anticipated visit of the Brandon Wheat Kings. Liam Liston and Spencer Galbraith took on their old team mates, while former Hurricane goalie Brandon Anderson was back in town. Anderson got the rest after starting the previous night in Medicine Hat.</p>

<p>Buonassisi and Galbraith are all smiles after the Hurricanes take a 2-1 lead in the first.</p>

<p>A little bit of turkey bowling fun during the second intermission.</p>

<p>It was another game that the Hurricanes seemed to have a handle on early, but just couldn&#39;t hang on for a full game. Brandon sealed the 4-2 victory with an empty net goal.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6281715022/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6211/6281715022_b89a592024.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by canescast, on Flickr"></a></p>

<p>A couple of days later the Hurricanes unveiled their military appreciation jerseys to be worn on November 9th. We&#39;ve already got a <a href="http://www.canescast.ca/article/2011/10/military-appreciation-jersey-unveiled">full page of photos of that event that you can check out</a>.</p>

<p>The Portland Winterhawks came to town on the 28th and Juraj Bezuch put in a good effort on the Hurricanes&#39; behalf.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6290572838/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6098/6290572838_0be404389f.jpg" alt="Juraj Bezuch by canescast, on Flickr"></a></p>

<p>Bezuch had several good chances, but couldn&#39;t manage to find his way onto the scoresheet.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6290136177/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6046/6290136177_00eeffaaa3.jpg" alt="Hurricanes goal by canescast, on Flickr"></a></p>

<p>He was on the doorstep when Sam McKechnie opened the scoring in the first period, though.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6290278975/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6057/6290278975_9aaa644005.jpg" alt="Sam Mckechnie trades lefts with Derrick Pouliot by canescast, on Flickr"></a></p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.hockeyfights.com/leagues/5">HockeyFights.com</a>, the Hurricanes are among the WHL&#39;s leaders in fights so far this year with 19. Here&#39;s Sam McKechnie in a second period fight.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6290807890/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6220/6290807890_4dcb40a0e3.jpg" alt="Sam Mckechnie has some parting words for Derrick Pouliot by canescast, on Flickr"></a></p>

<p>After the fight, McKechnie had a few parting words for Derrick Pouliot.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6290824350/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6092/6290824350_f0114689cd.jpg" alt="Sledge hockey demonstration by canescast, on Flickr"></a></p>

<p>During the second intermission was a sledge hockey demonstration from Hockey Alberta. I&#39;m still amazed at how fast they can skate on those sleds, and even more at how hard they can shoot with those short sticks.</p>

<p>The Hurricanes led early, but their illness depleted roster just couldn&#39;t hold on for long against Portland. Cam Braes and Brady Ramsay split time on defence to help out the four healthy defenders who were able to play. 4-1 was the final with Lethbridge-native Brad Ross scoring the empty netter.</p>

<p>Finally we come to the end of October with a Saturday night game against the Rebels.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6293626930/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6042/6293626930_9ae28cb8ae.jpg" alt="Nick Buonassisi by canescast, on Flickr"></a></p>

<p><em>Hey everybody, come see how good I look.</em></p>

<p>I&#39;ve made my thoughts known on these third jerseys. This was the first of what I hope will be many games this year featuring the throwback uniform.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6293637532/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6235/6293637532_91bc28b109.jpg" alt="Macoy Erkamps by canescast, on Flickr"></a></p>

<p>We haven&#39;t seen enough of Albin on the blog yet this year, so here he is.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6293159975/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6211/6293159975_4da9eddf44.jpg" alt="Russ Maxwell and Patrik Bartosak by canescast, on Flickr"></a></p>

<p>Brody Sutter&#39;s scoring attempt is smothered by Bartosak.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6293691658/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6107/6293691658_e7793611db.jpg" alt="Juraj Bezuch goes horizontal for the puck by canescast, on Flickr"></a></p>

<p>Juraj gets upended in the slot. Fans wanted a call here, but weren&#39;t able to convince the refs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6293179493/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6116/6293179493_b745c93ebb.jpg" alt="Brody Sutter fires wide as Patrik Bartosak sprawls to make a save by canescast, on Flickr"></a></p>

<p>Sutter fires one just wide on a tough angle. It was that kind of a night.</p>

<p>The Rebels took this one 5-0, closing out the Hurricanes&#39; winless month of October. With that we will turn the page and hope for a fresh start and more wins in November.</p>
