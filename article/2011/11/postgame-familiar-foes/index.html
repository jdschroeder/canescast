        <p>For the third time in six games, the Hurricanes went up against the Red Deer Rebels on Tuesday night. The Hurricanes’ 5-1 win that featured five fights was surely fresh in everyone’s mind as the Rebels looked to avoid a sweep of the three game set and an extension of a five game winless streak that has seen them drop from the top of the conference down to seventh.</p>

<p>Both teams are currently suffering losses to their line-ups. After taking a hit from behind in Red Deer on Friday night, Macoy Erkamps joined Dan Johnston on the injured list, and an illness to Albin Blomqvist further thinned the Hurricane blue line. Joel Topping was unavailable for call-up due to strep throat, so Cam Braes dropped back as the fifth defenceman and with Juraj Bezuch out due to illness as well, Reid Duke was called up to fill a spot on the forward lines. Red Deer, meanwhile, is without the injured Adam Kambeitz for a month or so, and Turner Elson who is currently serving a six game suspension for the hit that injured Erkamps.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>One might have expected some early fireworks in this game after the feisty affair on Friday. The opposite was actually true as the teams opened the game rather tentatively. It took four minutes of back and forth before the Hurricanes started the flow with the games first scoring opportunity on a Graham Hood drive toward the net. That prompted the play to open up a bit more and each team managed to generate a few chances. A little beyond the midway point of the first period, Phil Tot was hit awkwardly in open ice and left the game favouring his left arm. Shortly after, Colton Mayor found a seam in the Hurricanes’ defence shortly after a face-off and snapped one past Damien Ketlo’s glove to open the scoring for Red Deer. Less than three minutes later Alex Petrovic delivered an elbow to the head of Jamal Watson earning a major penalty and game misconduct for checking to the head. The Hurricanes wasted no time in capitalizing with Brady Ramsay sliding the puck clear of a scrum at the top of the crease to Cam Braes who lifted a backhander inside the right post to even the score at one apiece.</p>

<p>Special teams started to play a bigger role in the second period when Josh Cowen took a pair of penalties early, followed up by a pair by Brady Ramsay. Both teams were successful in killing their penalties, although I would suggest it was the Hurricanes’ who came out of it looking stronger, generating several one-timer opportunities for Braes and Brody Sutter on the powerplay, while keeping the Rebels from registering a shot in four minutes of powerplay time. Midway through the period Reid Duke came close to notching his first WHL goal, diving at a centering pass to beat a Red Deer defender. His attempt floated high of the goal, but would have made for a memorable first goal. Graham Hood continued to use his strength on the forecheck, outmuscling a Rebel for the puck behind the goal line and feeding it out front for Sutter who fired a quick one that trickled through Rebels’ goalie Bolton Pouliot to give the Hurricanes a 2-1 lead.</p>

<p>Hood kept things going the Hurricanes’ way early in the third period by catching Cowen in the trolley tracks. Late in the third, Jamal Watson used his speed to get a step on the Rebels’ defence for a chance on goal. It appeared Watson attempted to avoid a collision with Pouliot while being driven in by the defender; however, the referee saw things differently and assessed Watson a goaltender interference penalty. With Watson in the box, Pouliot headed for the bench to give the Rebels a 6-on-4 advantage to press for the tying goal. Brody Sutter snuffed out those hopes by clearing the puck out of the Hurricanes’ crease and 180 feet into the Red Deer net to seal a 3-1 victory with the Hurricanes’ first shorthanded goal of the season.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>...why the Hurricanes won. Puck pressure. It’s part of the aggressive play that the Hurricanes have been improving upon lately, and it was evident tonight at both ends of the rink. Strong forechecking, especially from Brady Ramsay and Sam Mckechnie, resulted in numerous own-zone turnovers by the Rebels, and continuous pressure on attacking puck carriers cut down on the Rebels’ opportunities inside the Hurricanes’ blue line. Red Deer went 0/6 on the powerplay, in large part due to the way the Hurricane penalty killers effectively pressured the puck carrier, forcing early puck movement rather than opportunities toward the goal.</p>

<p>Tonight we give the honour to a guy who plays an inglorious role: Tyler Kizuik. Kizuik’s importance to this team has increased substantially with the injuries and sickness that have plagued the Hurricanes’ defence this season, and the past few games have seen him rounding into form. Not only has he established himself as a strong defensively aware stay-at-home defenceman, but he has also improved in his ability to confidently move the puck forward on the rush and contribute to an offensive zone set-up. The general rule with a defenceman in Kizuik’s role is that going unnoticed likely means you played a good game. Tonight, we’re giving Kizuik some positive notice.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>Back <a href="http://www.canescast.ca/article/2011/11/postgame-identity">on November 18 I wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This identity is sure to be tested in the coming weeks. Before the month is out, the Hurricanes will face the Rebels twice more, as well as three games against the Edmonton Oil Kings…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In these six games against the Rebels and Oil Kings, I would say that the Hurricanes’ identity has stood up, going 4-2 in that stretch and leapfrogging Prince Albert and Everett to escape the WHL cellar. Now the Hurricanes move on to face some new opponents and new challenges.</p>

<p>The first of those challenges is a short trip down highway 3 to take on the rival Tigers in Medicine Hat on Wednesday night. It’s likely that the team will be a little short-manned again before getting Johnston and Erkamps back for Saturday&#39;s home game against the Saskatoon Blades.</p>

<p>Be sure to follow CanesCast for all the updates from Medicine Hat, or tune in to CJOC 94.1 or Shaw TV for the 7:00 start.</p>
