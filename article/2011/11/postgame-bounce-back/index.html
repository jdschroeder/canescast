        <p>After stringing together consecutive wins for the first time this season, the Hurricanes were handed an embarrassing 10-3 defeat at the hands of the Edmonton Oil Kings on Wednesday night. Tonight brought another formidable challenge, facing the Red Deer Rebels on the road. The last time the Hurricanes won a game at the Enmax Centrium was January 31, 2009 (fun fact: Michael Tadjdeh earned a 38 save shut out on that evening). The Hurricanes also hadn’t managed a win on the road since the season opener in Medicine Hat back in September, so a long losing streak could be broken tonight.</p>

<p>The Hurricanes looked to get some traction tonight, while the well rested Rebels hope to snap a two game winless streak on home ice. A feisty affair would be in store.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6335851993/"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6116/6335851993_88dbc0fb9e.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>Each team was down one of their top defencemen tonight: the Hurricanes still missing Dan Johnston after taking a hit from behind into the boards on Saturday night, and the Rebels’ Matt Dumba serving a suspension for a slashing infraction against Saskatoon.</p>

<p>The Hurricanes came out with a good jump as they have in their recent successful games. Brody Sutter got things started for real seven minutes into the game, drawing a holding penalty against Alex Petrovic, and then snapping a screened shot past Patrik Bartosak only ten seconds into the powerplay. Just a few minutes later Damien Ketlo covered the puck at the side of the Hurricanes’ goal and a scrum quickly escalated into a fight between Adam Henry and Cory Millette. Not a spirited scrap as WHL fights go, but it did set the tone for what was to come. Later in the period Phil Tot followed up a missed chance behind the goal line and passed the puck to Nick Buonassisi who continued it on to Cam Braes. Braes slipped the puck past Bartosak to give the Hurricanes a 2-0 lead, and Buonassisi his 100th career point.</p>

<p>The rough stuff continued moments later when Brady Ramsay and Justin Weller dropped the gloves behind the play. The Rebels’ 6’3” defenceman used his size advantage to keep Ramsay at bay and get the edge in another underwhelming fight. On the ensuing face-off Jaimen Yakubowski and Locke Muller provided the fans with a fight worth watching, both throwing plenty of big punches; Give Yakubowski the edge.</p>

<p>Early in the second period Adam Kambeitz delivered a hit from behind, driving Adam Henry dangerously into the boards. Russ Maxwell stepped in to fight Kambeitz and ended up being assessed an instigating penalty, leaving the Hurricanes shorthanded. It didn’t take long for another scrap to break out as Spencer Galbraith went at it with Josh Cowen at center ice. A little past the midway point of the second period with Cam Braes off for delay of game, Colten Mayor slapped a loose puck from between Albin Blomqvist’s legs and past Ketlo to get the Rebels on the board. The momentum seemed to be shifting in the Rebels’ favour in the second period, but the Hurricanes managed to escape 40 minutes still leading by one.</p>

<p>Not quite five minutes into the third period, Braes fired one from a sharp angle past Bartosak’s blocker to restore the Hurricanes’ two goal lead. Just over a minute later Jay Merkley fired one from behind that net that caromed off of Bartosak’s leg and in to extend the lead to 4-1. Just beyond the midway point of the third, Macoy Erkamps was hit from behind into the end boards behind the Hurricanes’ net. Turner Elson was assessed a boarding minor, but it was evened out by an instigating penalty after Erkamps jumped up and threw down his gloves. Rich Preston gave referee Andy Thiessen an earful for letting the Rebels get off easy on same dangerous hits along the boards. Nick Buonassisi proceeded to ice the game with a powerplay goal moments later, closing out the Hurricanes’ 5-1 rout of the Rebels.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>... why the Hurricanes won: Special teams. The powerplay and penalty kill have both been areas of weakness for much of the season, but tonight the Hurricanes owned this facet of the game, going 2/3 with the man advantage, and 4/5 on the penalty kill.</p>

<p>Russ Maxwell gets the nod here tonight. The three stars (1. Ketlo, 2. Braes, 3. Sutter) may have had more glamourous results tonight, but Maxwell had a good all around game, providing some good penalty killing and stepping up to defend his teammate Adam Henry after a questionable hit.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>Notwithstanding Wednesday night’s result, things are starting to look up for the Hurricanes. Three wins in their last four games is a good start that can hopefully form the foundation for a bunch more wins this season. Looking aroudn the league, the Hurricanes are now only a point shy of catching the Prince Albert Raiders and Everett Silvertips to move out of the WHL’s cellar. Tonight’s game was a complete effort that reflected what this team is capable of against one of the league’s better teams.</p>

<p>Two more games remain in the six pack against Red Deer and Edmonton, and both should be pretty highly charged affairs. Saturday night the Hurricanes visit the Edmonton Oil Kings at 7:00 with hopes of avenging the 10-3 drubbing from earlier this week. The Rebels will return to Lethbridge on Tuesday as a follow up to tonight’s feisty game.</p>
