        <p>After working their socks off last night and getting nothing for their efforts, the Canes took the short journey north to take on local rivals, Calgary Hitmen. A team they had the measure of last time around, edging a goal fest in their home opener, 6-5.</p>

<p>Since then, these teams have gone on quite a different path with the Canes recording 3-17-0-1 and the Hitmen chalking up a 8-9-1-1 record, having lost their last game 5-4 to the Seattle T-Birds on Friday night.</p>

<p>The Canes were hoping for a similar result to last time they met, as they looked for what would be their second away win of the season and their 4th during this campaign.</p>

<p>The Hurricanes arrive in Calgary having shown they can compete with the best of them, more than matching the work rate and effort of the Tri-City Americans, but continue to search for another tick in the win column.</p>

<p>The big question on the fans minds is, can the Hurricanes bring it for a second day, or was their efforts last night too much for them to repeat for a second game in a row?</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<h1>1st Period</h1>

<p>The Canes were on the back foot from the off as the Hitmen took the game to the Hurricanes.
Calgary opened the scoring with almost 4 minutes gone, as Sylvester fed Cheek from behind the net. Canes trailed 1-0 and looked to be a little off the pace so far in this game.</p>

<p>With the Canes getting into penalty trouble as Cam Braes and Nick Buonassisi both got called for roughing after some pushing and shoving in front of the Hurricanes net, allowed the Hitmen to score 2 quick power play goals which left the Canes with a mountain to climb trailing by 3 with just 12 minutes gone.</p>

<p>However, this Lethbridge team has character and after the Canes started to hustle and Oslanski got a great 2 on 1 rush out of the penalty box to get the Canes fired up. A nice rush led to Landon Oslanski feeding Graham Hood to get the Canes on the scoresheet with under 3 minutes left in the first, 3-1.</p>

<p>Nick Buonassisi made it a 1 goal game, 30 seconds later with some great work behind the net scoring with the wrap around and the Canes were back in the game, 3-2.</p>

<p>The period ended with the Canes skating hard, going in trailing by a goal, 3-2, having been outshot 13-7 after 20 minutes.</p>

<h1>2nd Period</h1>

<p>Canes picked up were they left off in the first and continued to pile the pressure on the Hitmen.
Canes with their first power play opportunity of the game created a few chances but nothing of note as they could not take advantage of playing with the extra man.</p>

<p>Calgary doubled their lead as Gayle with a highlight reel goal skating from the red line showing great movement to get Liam Liston going post-to-post beating him low on the blocker side to double the Hitmen lead.</p>

<p>Things started to slow a little as both sides tired late in the period from the frenetic pace of the 1st period and first 15 minutes of the second.</p>

<p>Watson had a great chance in close to score for the Canes, but Glover saved well as the rookie line of Erkamps, Merkley and Watson continued to cause the Hitmen problems.</p>

<p>A fluke deflection left Liston flat footed as Gogolev put the puck on the net after winning the face-off to the right of the Canes goal and Calgary led by 3, 5-2.</p>

<p>Another tough period as the Canes played hard and matched the effort of the Hitmen, but came undone due to a great piece of individual skill from Gayle and a tough bounce as the Hitmen scored 2 unanswered goals to give Calgary the lead 5-2 after 2 periods.</p>

<p>The Canes having been outshot, 22-16, after 40 minutes.</p>

<h1>3rd Period.</h1>

<p>A much slower pace in the 3rd from the previous two periods saw the Canes continue to put the pressure on Calgary, but not really making any impact when in the Hitmen blue zone.</p>

<p>Another power play goal extended the Hitmen&#39;s lead to 6-2 as the efforts of the last 2 days seemed to be taking their toll on the Hurricanes.</p>

<p>Calgary cleared up at the back time after time as the Canes tried to carve out openings. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6336607264/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6060/6336607264_d609298b19_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>The rookies Watson, Merkley and Bezuch continued to link up well and forced the Hitmen to cough up the puck, with a little more guile and experience could have scored a couple in the third.</p>

<p>Calgary native Watson, in particular, having a couple of great chances to reduce the deficit.</p>

<p>Canes continued to press, but with the exploits in the first 2 periods, they couldn&#39;t keep the pressure on and started to fade late on. </p>

<p>The Canes outshot the Hitmen 15-7 in the 3rd but unable to get past Glover who dealt with the Canes pressure with ease.</p>

<p>Canes lost this one by a score of 6-2 having outshot the Hitmen, 31-29 in regulation.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>In a hard fought game, the Canes hustled hard at times, but after last night&#39;s exploits things just weren&#39;t falling for the Canes who looked to overplay the puck at times when a simple pass might have paid dividends. </p>

<h2><em><a href="http://lethbridgewebdesign.ca">Lethbridge Web Design</a></em> Hardest Working Hurricane: Graham Hood</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6293189735/" title="Graham Hood screens Patrik Bartosak by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6235/6293189735_1502ed368e_z.jpg" alt="Graham Hood screens Patrik Bartosak"></a></p>

<p>Played hard, working deep in the Hitmen zone to press the Hitmen forcing several turnovers. Scored a great goal to get the Hurricanes on the scoresheet and continues to step up game after game.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>The Canes worked hard but as the game went on, they couldn&#39;t keep the pace up, not getting enough pressure in the offensive zone after awesome work to get back within a goal scoring 2 quickly at the end of the first.
Having shipped 3 goals early on, it proved to be a big hole to come back from, eventually running out of steam with 2 tough games in 2 days.</p>

<h2>Next up</h2>

<p>Next game, Hurricanes host the Rebels, Friday, 18th November, puck drops @ 7pm.</p>
