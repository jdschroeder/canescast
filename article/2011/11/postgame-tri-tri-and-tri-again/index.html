<p>With the return to Lethbridge of long time Hurricane defenceman Derek Ryckman, the Canes had even more reason to step up their play and show the Tri-City Americans who hold a record of 14-5-0-0, that they are no pushovers. 
Tri-City come to Lethbbridge on the back of a hard fought shoot-out win, having beaten the Tigers 4-3, the night before.
With Tri-City having played 3 games in 4 nights, they rested starting goaltender Ty Rimmer, opting to start Eric Comrie between the pipes. </p>

<p>This was the night for the Canes to compete, play strong on every shift and for each player to stand up and be counted, and they didn&#39;t let us down.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6339342454/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6235/6339342454_a28a4a085d_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<h1>1st Period</h1>

<p>The Canes got off to a quick start hustling hard and taking the play to Tri-City getting the first 2 shots of the game on Comrie putting the Americans under lots of pressure from the off. 
However, their good work, was to be undone as the could not keep Tri-city out as they broke the deadlock with their first shot of the game, beating Damien Ketlo low glove side to open the scoring.</p>

<p>This was not a night for the Canes to roll over and they kept playing hard and pressing to get back into the game.
Canes were very aggressive on the penalty kill as they forced the turnover and kept the puck up in the Americans blue zone. Sutter, especially working hard to keep the puck tight in on the boards to chew up valuable penalty minutes.</p>

<p>Tri-City doubled their lead on the powerplay beating an un-sighted Damien Ketlo who could do nothing as the shot pinged in of the post.
The Ams looked to have made it 3-1 after the puck was turned in at the far post, however under video review, the puck was turned into the net with the forward motion of the upper arm of the Tri-City player - no goal!</p>

<p>Still the Canes kept pressing and after great stick work from Bezuch, which carved open the Americans defence, Jay Merkley was on hand to force the puck home from the rebound giving the Hurricanes the goal they so richly deserved.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6338592037/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6213/6338592037_39dbe10e29_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>Playing some beautiful hockey, Erkamps, Oslanski and Tot opened up the Americans defence once again with some behind the back passing that left the fans on the edge of their seats as chance after chance came, but the Canes couldn&#39;t beat Comrie who was standing strong during the dominant play of the Canes. </p>

<p>The period ended with the Canes down by a goal, 2-1, leading on the shot clock 8-5.</p>

<h1>2nd Period</h1>

<p>Canes picked up were they left off in the first and continued to pile the pressure on the Americans after keeping pace with them well in the first. </p>

<p>For Canes fans it was excellent viewing watching the Canes competing on every level and matching the play of Tri-City.
Cam Braes opened up the Tri-City defence again with a great show of individual skill, but Comrie was proving to be a worthy stand in and was equal to his trickery. With shots coming thick and fast, with the boys on fire, Merkley and Tot forcing outstanding saves from Comrie. </p>

<p>Not to be outdone, Brody Sutter evened things up as he forced the turnover and closing in on goal, roofed the puck to tie it up at 2-2 on the powerplay, unassisted.</p>

<p>Another unlucky bounce saw the Americans re-take the lead as Messier caught the puck high off the glass behind Ketlo&#39;s goal and dropping it at his feet, scored the easy goal with Ketlo caught watching from the other post. Nice work from Daniel Johnston as he defended a 3 on 1 rush perfectly and a great save post-to-post from Damien Ketlo, kept the score at 3-2, Tri-City as the Americans picked up the pace and kept Lethbridge on the back foot. </p>

<p>Tri-City made it 4-2 on the powerplay after Jamal Watson chasing down a puck fed into the Amercians&#39; blue zone, overskated and ran into Comrie, for a goal tender interference call made all the more curious as Comrie was well out of his crease.</p>

<p>Canes continued to press, not letting Tri-City get the upper hand, and after Nick Buonassisi was brought down when through on goal, the Canes were awarded a penalty shot. Buonassisi, showed his skills whilst keeping his nerve as he beat Comrie with the deke on the backhand, 4-3.</p>

<p>Jay Merkley had several chances to tie things up, but Comrie made several excellent saves to keep the score at 4-3 after 2 periods, with the Canes having been outshot by a pair, 18-16.</p>

<p>The Canes had now put in 2 very strong periods of hockey, which was appreciated by the Enmax crowd as they left the ice to an ovation having payed their hearts out matching Tri-City for work rate, inventive play and for their hustle as they broke up attack after attack with some timely defensive work and down right gutsy play.</p>

<h1>3rd Period.</h1>

<p>The third period couldn&#39;t have been more different than the previous two as Tri-City really stepped up their game coming fast out of the gate and although the Canes carved several openings, excellent defensive work combine with skillful breakout play showed the gulf in quality between Lethbridge and their southern neighbours.</p>

<p>A slap shot from the point, allowed Tri-City to extend their lead, 5-3 with 5 minutes gone in the third as they continued to break up any Canes attack covering for each other perfectly at the back, then forcing the rush to continually put the Lethbridge goal under pressure.</p>

<p>The Canes continued to work hard, throwing everything into it, but couldn&#39;t make their pressure pay failing to get a shot on the Tri-City goaltender during the third period.</p>

<p>Looking to pull a goal back, the Hurricanes had every chance as the puck pinged around in front of the Tri-City goal, but after snuffing out the attack, the Ams went up the other end and in another goal mouth scramble, had enough pressure to force it past Ketlo to give them a 3 goal cushion, 6-3.</p>

<p>The Hurricanes appeared to have a lifeline when Jaimen Yakubowski got hit hard to the boards late in the period as Tri-City got called for a double minor for checking from behind, this looked like the perfect opportunity for the Canes to craft a comeback. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, even with the man advantage for 4 minutes, the Canes couldn&#39;t stop the visitors from extending their lead to 7-3 as they beat Ketlo on the rush shorthanded.</p>

<p>In a hard fought game, the Canes gave their all and yet couldn&#39;t bridge the gap between these 2 teams losing by a score of 7-3 having been outshot by the Americans, 36-16 in regulation.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>Awesome penalty killing tonight, forcing the turnover and raising their game to meet the hard work rate and standards set by the leaders of the western conference, unfortunately this wasn&#39;t enough. 
Penalties contributed to their un-doing and although they worked hard through out this game, when they got to the third, they couldn&#39;t match the work rate of the Americans.</p>

<h2><em><a href="http://lethbridgewebdesign.ca">Lethbridge Web Design</a></em> Hardest Working Hurricane: Jay Merkley</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6339343008/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6098/6339343008_efa86c0c40_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>Jay had an excellent game tonight hustling all the way, scoring the opening goal for the Hurricanes after nice stick work by Macoy Erkamps, forced the play and led his line on every shift. Another great night for Jay, even if the score wasn&#39;t what he or the team would have wanted.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>The Canes were more than a match for Tri-City for two periods, but they just couldn&#39;t match their work rate in the third as the Americans stepped up their game. 
Defensively, they are starting to look like a tighter unit and offensively they are really working hard and creating opportunities.
Against weaker opposition they would have won this comfortably as they took another big step on their way to becoming the side that started the season so full of expectations and promise. </p>

<h2>Next up</h2>

<p>Next game, Sunday afternoon as the Canes travel to Calgary to take on the Hitmen, puck drops @ 2pm. </p>
