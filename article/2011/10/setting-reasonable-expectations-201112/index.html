        <p>I&#39;ve had several people ask me lately how I think the Hurricanes will fare this season. Others have given me their opinions, often pessimistic and founded on the results of the last two seasons. These discussions have got me thinking about where I expect this team to finish the season. Rationally, reasonably, what can we expect from this team?</p>

<h2>Defining success</h2>

<p>I&#39;m going to suggest that a playoff appearance by the Hurricanes would render this season a success. After two seasons of <em>rebuilding</em> and missing the playoffs, this is an obvious target, but far from being a foregone conclusion, especially for a team whose roster includes four 16 year olds and six 17 year olds. A 20 win season two years ago should be considered the bottoming-out of this rebuild with the Hurricanes progressing closer to contention each year. Finishing top-eight in the eastern conference in 2011/12: success.</p>

<h2>So, are they a playoff team?</h2>

<p>With our definition of success now established, is it likely that this Lethbridge Hurricanes team will be able to achieve that target? Let&#39;s take a look at how the playoff picture has figured since the current playoff format was adopted in 2007/08.</p>

<p>There&#39;s some pretty wild fluctuation from year-to-year when it comes to the playoff cut-off in the eastern conference, which makes it hard to guess at how many points will be required to make the playoffs in a given year. I&#39;m going to use the average of 75 points as an arbitrary target that would qualify the Hurricanes for a spot in the post-season. A 75 point season would require a 16 point improvement over last season&#39;s finish. The abnormally high number of shootout losses last season may suggest that the Hurricanes ought to have won a few more games than they managed, so let&#39;s say that they need to win seven or eight more games this season to achieve an 8th place finish.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to come down on the side of optimism and say that yes, the Lethbridge Hurricanes will make the playoffs this season, contingent on getting consistent goaltending from Brandon Anderson (<a href="/article/2011/10/talking-20s-and-goalies">or perhaps Damien Ketlo</a>), and not having to suffer through a plague of injuries. I don&#39;t expect better than 8th or possibly 7th place, and a likely first round playoff exit, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unreasonable to think the Hurricanes will be playing beyond March 17.</p>

<h2>Are they moving in the right direction?</h2>

<p>This question is more subjective and long-term in nature, and perhaps a bit of a softball given that the Hurricanes are on the upswing of junior hockey&#39;s talent cycle. Top talent moves on, you have a couple of bad seasons, make some early draft picks, and a couple of years later you&#39;ve got yourself a competitive team again. There is some impressive young talent on this team already, and we haven&#39;t yet entered the Pilon/Duke era. As these players continue to mature, gain strength, and adapt to the demands of the WHL schedule, the Lethbridge Hurricanes will become a force to be reckoned with. Making the playoffs is a reasonable target for 2011/12. By the time 2013/14 rolls around we&#39;ll be able to set these expectations considerably higher.</p>
