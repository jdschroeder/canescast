        <p>Four games in the books now, a modest .500 record, and a few home games to get a good look at the team; It&#39;s time for us to start throwing some observations and opinions around.</p>

<h2>We&#39;re going to play some defence, right?</h2>

<p>While rookie Macoy Erkamps has fit in nicely on the Hurricanes&#39; blue line, some of the veterans are going to need to step up their games. Landon Oslanski and Reid Jackson each committed bad own zone turnovers leading to Hitmen goals on Friday, earning themselves some time off on Saturday night for all the wrong reasons. Being fresh off of the Flames&#39; prospects camp, more is certainly expected of Jackson in particular.</p>

<p>Brandon Anderson&#39;s weekend wasn&#39;t exactly stellar, either, putting up a .892 save percentage while allowing nine goals in the two home games. In Anderson&#39;s defence, he faced 83 shots, and four of those goals came on powerplay opportunities. Like Jackson, though, Anderson is an NHL prospect, and more will be expected of the veteran goaltender.</p>

<h2>Ho-hum powerplay</h2>

<p>So far the Canes have struck on four of 23 powerplay opportunities, moderately better than the dismal 15.2% efficiency that placed them 21st in the league last season. Early indicators are that the powerplay still needs some work as the perimeter passing isn&#39;t leading to many scoring opportunities.</p>

<h2>The kids are alright</h2>

<p>One of the early season questions no doubt was how well the rookies on the roster could compete. So far we&#39;ve seen Macoy Erkamps fit in very comfortably on the blue line, moving the puck rather well alongside Derek Ryckman. Sam Mckechnie has been impressive with his speed. Jay Merkley is the only rookie to have skated in all four games so far, and he&#39;s on a point a game pace.</p>

<h2>The imports</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6199610778/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6007/6199610778_6526900d5b_m.jpg" alt="Juraj Bezuch celebrates"></a></p>

<p>Well Jurah Bezuch has shown he knows how to celebrate a goal, and Albin Blomqvist perhaps spends a bit too much time in the penalty box. The transition of moving halfway around the world to play hockey as an 18 year old is a pretty substantial one, so I&#39;ll give these guys some more time to settle before looking for big things from them.</p>

<h2>What about those 20 year olds?</h2>

<p>There are five over-age players on this roster, one of whom is a goalie. Rich Preston hinted that Damien Ketlo would be moved, and that Matt Marantz was a temporary solution to Austin Fyten&#39;s knee injury. If that&#39;s to be taken at face value, we can assume that Ketlo and Marantz will both depart in due course and Braes, Fyten, and Sutter will remain.</p>

<p>I have heard it suggested, though that perhaps Preston ought to hang on to Ketlo, trading Brandon Anderson instead. It&#39;s an interesting situation, since a 19 year old NHL prospect has inherently more trade value than a 20 year old, even of similar ability. While I can see the potential upside to such a move, it still leaves the problem of carrying five over-age players. I would wager that the simpler solution plays itself out here.</p>

<h2>Hitting the road</h2>

<p>The boys will now embark on their first true road trip of the season, a three game swing into Saskatchewan where they will face Moose Jaw, Regina, and Swift Current. The Warriors (3-1) and Pats (4-1) are off to solid starts, while the Broncos (1-3) are occupying the other end of the standings. The early road trips are when a team can start to come together and develop some chemistry (or so the narrative goes).</p>

<p>While some flaws have reared their heads, the season is still young and optimism still abounds. It&#39;s time to see who this team is and what they can accomplish.</p>
