        <p>Twelve games and ten losses into the season, it&#39;s a fair question to ask: are the Lethbridge Hurricanes already out of this year&#39;s WHL playoff race?</p>

<p>Early in this losing skid, I was defending the team&#39;s chances, insisting that they would turn a corner and be a competitive team down the stretch. That could very well still happen, but it will take much more than <em>competitive</em> to have a hope of overcoming the hole that they have dug for themselves over the past four weeks.</p>

<p>On his blog at CBC.ca, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/opinion/2011/10/friedmanoct17.html">Elliotte Friedman took a look at recent NHL history and how teams have fared when falling behind in the first month of the season</a>. Spoiler: it&#39;s not good news if you&#39;re more than three points back. <a href="http://gdrinnan.blogspot.com/2011/10/out-of-playoffs-in-november.html">Gregg Drinnan has already discussed Friedman&#39;s article as it relates to the Hurricanes</a>, but I&#39;d like to dig a little further into just what it would take for the Hurricanes to make the post season.</p>

<p>Looking at the situation purely from a numbers perspective, the current pace of the top eight teams in the WHL&#39;s Eastern Conference is above a .630 win percentage, which would equate to just about 92 points to qualify for the playoffs. You&#39;ll remember that in <a href="/article/2011/10/setting-reasonable-expectations-201112">our previous article on setting expectations</a> we considered 75 points a reasonable playoff target, so the current pace is much more competitive than it has been over the past several years.</p>

<p>If that exceptional pace continues, the Hurricanes would need 87 more points in the final 60 games to crack the top eight. At a .725 win percentage, the Hurricanes would need to win almost three of every four games. That&#39;s as many as 45 wins–the same amount they won in the entire 2007/08 season en route to the Eastern Conference championship.</p>

<p>To even reach 75 points, which is looking like a very low projection that would not qualify them for the playoffs, the Hurricanes would need a win percentage of .583 for the remainder of the season. Achieving that would require as much as 35 more wins–12 more than they won all of last season.</p>

<p>Should they be able to stay healthy and get their act together in their own zone, I think the 75 point target could still be an outside possibility. Anything near 92 points, though, would be a miraculous turn of events.</p>

<p>I was hoping we wouldn&#39;t be drawing this sort of conclusion this season, especially only a month into the campaign, but nothing short of a remarkable turnaround from the Hurricanes will bring WHL playoff hockey back to Lethbridge for 2012.</p>
