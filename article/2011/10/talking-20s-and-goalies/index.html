        <p>With the revelation today that <a href="http://canesbroadcaster.blogspot.com/2011/10/hurricanes-moose-jaw-warriors.html">Austin Fyten will effectively miss the entire season</a>, the Lethbridge Hurricanes&#39; 20 year old situation has become considerably more complex. From the outset of camp it seemed clear that the only thing that would keep the Braes-Fyten-Sutter line from reuniting was the chance of Fyten or Sutter sticking with an AHL club. Unfortunately, the hard luck continues for Austin Fyten where injuries are concerned – you&#39;ll recall that he missed substantial time as a result of two injuries in the first half of last season as well.</p>

<p>The picture became a little less clear when Rich Preston acquired 20 year old goaltender Damien Ketlo from the Regina Pats after sending his midget goalies back to their respective camps, <a href="http://canesbroadcaster.blogspot.com/2011/09/hurricanes-prepare-for-final-pre-season.html">although Preston hinted strongly that Ketlo&#39;s tenure in Lethbridge would be short-lived</a>. The acquisition last week of Matt Marantz from Spokane seemed to be a response to Fyten&#39;s assignment to the 45 day disabled list, and it left the Hurricanes with five 20 year olds, further convoluting what was at one point such a cut and dried situation.</p>

<p>Given the expectation that Fyten will miss at least six months, meaning he would return well after playoffs begin, the Hurricanes are really now down to four over-age players and will only need to shed one. It likely goes without saying that Cam Braes and Brody Sutter aren&#39;t going anywhere, so the decision is between Matt Marantz and Damien Ketlo. Let&#39;s take a look at the implications of keeping each of those players.</p>

<h2>Keep Matt Marantz</h2>

<p>In some ways, this can be considered the more simple of the two alternatives. Marantz acts as somewhat of a replacement for Austin Fyten, although without the same impact on your line-up that Fyten was expected to provide. Meanwhile, releasing or trading Damien Ketlo leaves you with a tandem of Anderson and Kovacs, which seems to have been the plan all along. The team is ultimately made weaker by having to swap Fyten out, but with Marantz you are adding a proven WHL veteran who tallied 42 points last season, so the blow is less devastating than having to depend on an unproven rookie on a nightly basis.</p>

<h2>Keep Damien Ketlo</h2>

<p>This alternative is by far the more intriguing. By keeping Damien Ketlo, Matt Marantz would have some company in departing from the Hurricanes. Since Kovacs must be considered the goalie of the future, Brandon Anderson would be the odd man out. As an NHL prospect and 19 year old, Anderson has inherent trade value that could bring an 18 or 19 year old forward who could perhaps provide more value than Marantz in replacing Fyten. The viability of this situation may depend on the coaching staff&#39;s trust in Ketlo as a replacement for Anderson.</p>

<p>The possibility of this situation playing out seems to be real, as <a href="https://twitter.com/DarrellRomuld/status/121341084830937088">this quote from Chris Chisamore comes via CTV&#39;s Darrell Romuld</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s tough, the guys know something is coming and that&#39;s gotta be unsettling&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the deadline for reaching three 20 year olds approaches, it will be interesting to see Rich Preston&#39;s strategy for addressing this latest wrinkle in his roster.</p>
