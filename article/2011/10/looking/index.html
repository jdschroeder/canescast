        <p>Only eight games into what was supposed to be a promising season of turnaround for the Lethbridge Hurricanes, and already they find themselves near the bottom of the standings, looking up at a substantial challenge ahead of them in what is shaping up to be a competitive eastern conference.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been an ugly couple of weeks that have brought us to this point. Currently on a six game losing streak during which they have allowed 26 goals and scored 12. The powerplay has dried up almost entirely, striking only twice on 34 opportunities, bottoming out as the worst in the league at 11.5% overall. Meanwhile the opposition have scored on better than 25% of their powerplay opportunities during that same span; a decidedly mediocre penalty killing result.</p>

<p>To what can we attribute these early season woes? Sure, every team suffers injuries, and good teams find ways to overcome them, but the absences of Austin Fyten and Brody Sutter are making a big impact to the offensive performance, as is the loss of promising youngster Jay Merkley. Hurricane fans can hope that the forthcoming returns of Sutter and Merkley will cause the offence to start clicking a little more often, and hopefully improve the fortunes of the powerplay.</p>

<p>Similarly the loss of Reid Jackson has dealt a blow to the defence, but with the likes of veterans Johnston, Oslanski, Ryckman, and Kizuik still in the lineup, this is an area of the game that isn&#39;t relying on unproven rookies. If I were to pinpoint one area of frustration with the Hurricanes&#39; early performance, it would be defensive zone coverage. At times opposing players are permitted to move the puck too freely, and goal scoring plays seem to happen all too frequently where a player is given too much time and space in the slot. Collectively, this team needs to play tighter defensively, challenging puck carriers and being more aware of the players other than the puck carrier moving into scoring positions. These are mental mistakes, and they have been costly in the early going.</p>

<p>This is an area that I think we may see Rich Preston address via trade, especially given that he currently has a surplus of goaltenders, and could be shopping Brandon Anderson. A solid own-zone defenceman with some strength to clear the slot and the poise to settle things down inside the blue line could do wonders for this team defensively.</p>

<p>Over the course of this losing streak, the Hurricanes have registered 179 shots on goal while finding the twine only 12 times. 6.7% shooting efficiency is downright lousy, and the accompanying 87.4% save percentage over the same stretch isn&#39;t exactly stellar, either. According to the theory behind the advanced hockey statistic PDO, this would probably suggest the bounces have been going against the Hurricanes, and should balance out in the long run.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that PDO is calculated using <strong>even strength</strong> shooting and save percentages. Since the raw statistics at even strength are not readily available for WHL games as they are for the NHL, I don&#39;t have a precise calculation as to the Hurricanes&#39; true PDO. If I get ambitious some time, I may do some of my own counts to accurately calculate some advanced statistics over a stretch of games. For a good read on PDO, check out <a href="http://www.mc79hockey.com/?p=2996">http://www.mc79hockey.com/?p=2996</a>.</p>

<p>My point: I don&#39;t think what we&#39;ve seen of the Lethbridge Hurricanes this season is what we&#39;re going to see all season long. Call me an optimist, but for now, I&#39;m going to stick by my prediction that this team will squeeze its way into a playoff spot by season&#39;s end.</p>
