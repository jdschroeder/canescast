        <h1>What it's like to lose</h1>
        <div class="byline">October 31, 2011 - by Josh Schroeder</div>
        
        <p>It&#39;s tough to come up with something to write when the Hurricanes are getting the results they&#39;ve been getting lately. There&#39;s only so much I want to talk about why the team is losing, and it just feels patronizing to try to keep being overly optimistic, spewing feel-good clich&eacute;s and trying to shift the focus to the bright future we expect for the Lethbridge Hurricanes. Indulge me, if you will, as I spend some time today dwelling on the losses and exploring what it&#39;s like to lose.</p>

<p>Fans of the Hurricanes who follow the players on Twitter have been seeing updates like these lately:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sick and tired of losing. It sucks. (<a href="https://twitter.com/sutts19/status/130167197346693120">@sutts19</a>)</p>

<p>Need a win soo bad #canonlygoupfromhere (<a href="https://twitter.com/jaimen_yak/status/130151333486542848">@jaimen_yak</a>)</p>

<p>I just want to win. (<a href="https://twitter.com/jay_merkley/status/130160656174415872">@jay_merkley</a>)</p>

<p>I hear you, guys. I feel your pain.</p>

<p>As much as it&#39;s lousy to be a fan (or blogger) of a team that&#39;s losing, try to put yourself in the shoes of the players for a moment. I&#39;ve been there. I played hockey at a reasonably competitive level, and one season suffered through a .056 win percentage (three times worse than the Hurricanes right now!). Brody&#39;s right: losing sucks.</p>

<p>What&#39;s going through the head of a player whose team is on a thirteen game losing streak? I&#39;m no sport psychologist, but I can speak from my own experience. For starters, you&#39;re dealing with plenty of frustration. Have you seen Jay Merkley out there lately? Several chances on Saturday night alone, but the puck just won&#39;t seem to go in. Call it snakebitten, or squeezing the stick too tightly, but from the player&#39;s perspective it all equates to an agonizing situation when your best efforts aren&#39;t converting.</p>

<p>As a player it can feel like everything is going against you. Pucks aren&#39;t bouncing your way, the refs aren&#39;t giving you the calls, and meanwhile the injuries just seem to mount. Perhaps this is your mind playing tricks with you, rationalizing the struggle. Surely you can&#39;t be this badly outmatched; the reason for the losses must be outside of your realm of control.</p>

<p>The natural response can be personally trying to turn your team&#39;s fortunes, especially as a captain or a veteran. You think, &quot;I&#39;m going to turn this around for us; I&#39;m taking matters into my own hands,&quot; and you try to do too much. When too many players are making individual efforts, the team becomes marginalized. As it is said, <em>united we stand, divided we fall</em>.</p>

<p>If the losses mount for too long, the fear of failure dissipates, since failure seems inevitable. Finding motivation becomes more difficult while fewer fans come to the games, and the atmosphere becomes dull and muted. These things make losing nearly habitual, and it becomes very difficult to shake yourself out of the losing groove.</p>

<p>Losing streaks test your mettle, and they can define your character. What matters is how you respond to the accumulating losses and what you do to break out of your funk. Teams who allow blame and individual efforts to guide their efforts will continue to fall apart. Instead, they must learn that the way through the struggle includes a big dose of accountability and trust.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s the attitude of the players, not their skills, that is the biggest factor in determining whether you win or lose. (Harry Sinden)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a team as young as the Lethbridge Hurricanes, getting through a challenging losing streak could prove to be a valuable team-building opportunity, galvanizing a group of individuals into a team who have been to hell and back together. The current danger, though, exists in not knowing how far you must fall before hitting rock bottom.</p>

<p>Losing sucks, but it makes winning all the sweeter. Much like losing, winning can become habitual as streaks are formed. Help your Hurricanes kick-off a winning streak: get out to the Enmax, make some noise, and let them know you&#39;re behind them. When they bust this skid, we&#39;re going to have a heck of a party.</p>
