        <p>Breaking the losing streak has never been more important, especially when we have exBrandon players Liam Liston between the pipes and Spencer Galbraith in defence with us after the trade that sent Brandon Anderson east to Manitoba. However, Galbraith and Liston are not the only Canes with something to prove tonight with the Hurricanes just having passed a franchise record of 10 losses in a row everything is on the line as they look to turn things around.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<h3>First period</h3>

<p>Things looked to be taking a similar turn to previous games after Cam Braes was called for tripping and the Wheat kings scored on the early power play, 21 seconds in. However, this was a very different Hurricanes team and they Hustled and fought for every puck.
Hood charges the net, Buonassisi, Sutter and Merkley all hit the post to get the fans into this game.
Sutter scores the tieing goal after being fed by Braes to split the Wheaties defence.
Graham Hood has what looked like a legitimate goal, after whacking away at the pad of Wheaties goaltender Boes. The ref went upstairs and with an inconclusive replay, no goal was the resulting call. 
However, the Canes weren&#39;t done and after Brody Sutter plays the tic-tac-toe, opens up the Brandon defence feeding Buonnassisi to open his Canes account with the one timer beating Boes high on the glove side.
At this point the Canes were flying and looked like a team on the ascendancy, creating chance after chance, but lacking the final piece of the jigsaw which would have meant them going in after 20 minutes leading by a couple of goals.</p>

<p><em>Shots: 20-9 Canes</em></p>

<h3>2nd period</h3>

<p>Second period was a different story as both teams were feeling each othemselves out with no clear cut chances either way until Kizuik gets called for delay of game whilst trying to clear the puck. 
Seaman scores the resulting power play goal to tie it up with Liam Liston unsighted. From then on the Wheat Kings were back in the game and pressed on with the Canes staying strong defensively as Galbraith, Oslanski and Liston staying with the game plan of keeping things tight and closing down Brandon at every chance. 
Canes had their chances at the other end with the top line of Braes, Sutter and new boy Buonassisi combining well to open up the Wheat Kings defence, but Boes looked more assured in goal keeping the Canes at bay. This period the Canes were outshot 19 to 6 letting the Wheaties back in after closing them out in the first.</p>

<p><em>Shots: 26-27 wheaties</em></p>

<h3>Third Period</h3>

<p>Third started brightly with the Canes realizing that they needed to step it up in the third if they were to get anything our of this game.
Sutter was making all of the plays, charging the net and forcing the turnovers.
Canes took up were they left off in the first, pressed hard and forcing the rush, but couldn&#39;t drive it home.
Liston stood on his head, but again the penalties took their toll on the Canes as Brandon hits them with the sucker punch with just 10 seconds left in the penalty kill with less than 3 minutes left in the game, scoring close in to make it 3-2 Brandon.
Throwing everything at the Wheaties, Rich Preston pulled Liston for the extra man, and with the Canes whacking away on the doorstep, the puck wouldn&#39;t fall kindly for the Canes with heartbreak and the 11th loss of the season beckoning. 
Brandon scored the empty netter with Canes caught napping as they waited for the icing call that could never be with the wheat kings killing the penalty.
The score of 4-2 not reflecting the balance of the game nor the third period.
The Crowd loved everything about this game, but heart break was around the corner as penalties came back to sting the Canes in the tail. </p>

<p><em>Shots: 36-38 wheaties</em></p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>The Canes lost this in part due to them not breaking up the wheat kings momentum, when they had sought out and found the answer to beating this team, which was to put everything on net and pressure the goaltender. Boes often looking like the weakest link in a very effective and well oprganised Wheaties team.
When they had the puck at their feet, the Canes looked like a team that will cause many teams lots of problems, but without having a player finding space in the slot, will be doomed to clean up the rebounds. 
More of the intelligent puck moving of Brody Sutter and Buonassis&#39;s space finding and we will see lots more goal scoring from this Canes side. 
They do have to be more organized in defence and stop taking so many penalties.</p>

<h2><em><a href="http://lethbridgewebdesign.ca">Lethbridge Web Design</a></em> Hardest Working Hurricane Brody Sutter</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6201045451/" title="Brody Sutter by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6173/6201045451_59aacdab42.jpg" width="500" height="400" alt="Brody Sutter"></a></p>

<p>Made everything happen for the Canes tonight. The majority of the opportunities for the canes were due to his quick thinking and awesome stick handling. 
Scoring one and assisting on the give and go for Buonassisi&#39;s goal, played like a guy leading the top line, working hard on the powerplay doing everything in his power to get the win, but to no avail.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>This one was another tough loss for the Canes as they played some very exciting hockey, keeping the crowd on the edge of their seats throughout the game. This was a crowd pleaser in every way with the exception of the final result. A tough loss for the fans and players alike. Each and every player stood up tonight in an attempt to add to their 2 wins from the start of the season, unfortunately they fell a little short, but not for the lack of effort.</p>

<h2>Next up.....</h2>

<p>The Hurricanes play host to the Portland Winterhawks on Friday, October 28th. Tickets available from (403) 329 SEAT.
No games are easy, but the Canes continue to search for that elusive win to break this losing streak that now stands at 11 games.. it&#39;s a matter of time before it happens and with a bit of confidence can go on a winning run, let&#39;s hope it&#39;s soon.
