<p>Riding into this game against the Kamloops Blazers on a nine game loosing streak, a stretch of games equal to an eighth of a season, the objective was obvious: put one in the win column.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>Same old, same old for the start of this game with Kamloops scoring on a 3-on-1 after a neutral zone transition five minutes into the game. Another goal early in a powerplay for the Blazers and it was 2-0 halfway through the first period. It didn&#39;t take long for the Hurricanes to respond with Cam Braes taking a hit at the Kamloops blue line to get the puck to Brody Sutter who would snipe one inside the far post. Kamloops regained a two goal lead when Lipon was able to get two cracks from in close. Prior to the period ending, Russ Maxwell converted on a blocked shot that turned into a breakaway.</p>

<p>Plenty of excitement in the second period as Macoy Erkamps delivered a big hit and then dominated Lipon in a fight. Shortly after that Cam Braes evened the score with a big wrist shot top corner. At the mid-way point of the period Graham Hood made a long cross-ice pass to Jay Merkley who then moved it to Landon Oslanski in the slot. Oslanski showed a deft move for a defenceman, deking out Cole Cheveldave and giving the Hurricanes a 4-3 lead.</p>

<p>It was all downhill from there, though, as the Blazers scored three before the period was out, one goal a trickler through Liston&#39;s pads, another a screened one-timer, and another as Brendan Ranford barrelled through Liston&#39;s crease. A bad third period turnover in the slot led to a seventh goal, sealing the result for the visitors.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>... why the Hurricanes lost. Continued defensive zone breakdowns cost them another one tonight. You&#39;re not going to win many games when you allow 37 shots in the first two periods. From the Blazers&#39; first goal, scored on a 3-on-1 from a neutral zone transition, to the last, a bad turnover in front of the goal, this game underscored what the trouble has been during the month of October.</p>

<p>Russ Maxwell takes the honour tonight, centring the line that generated the best quality and quantity of scoring opportunities. Once again, despite his diminutive stature, Maxwell was looking to get physically involved tonight, throwing hits and getting into the scrums after the play. Of course, in these cases it doesn&#39;t hurt that he&#39;s got Graham Hood as a wing man. All-in-all it was a good showing from Maxwell that also produced a goal on a terrific single-handed effort.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>The losing streak now hits ten games with another tough test tomorrow evening against the Brandon Wheat Kings. It should be an interesting affair that will see Liston, Spencer Galbraith, and former Hurricane goalie Brandon Anderson all play against their former clubs less than a week after the big trade.</p>

<p>It will take a better defensive effort from the entire team if the Hurricanes are to beat the skilled Wheat Kings. In particular, they will need to be aware of the likes of Darian Dziurzynski who came over from Saskatoon last weekend and has score four times in three games since. The good news is that the Wheat Kings are closing out a seven game road trip that has had them on the road for nearly two weeks. If the Hurricanes can capitalize on any fatigue the Wheat Kings may be suffering, it could be a prime opportunity to get back into the win column.</p>
