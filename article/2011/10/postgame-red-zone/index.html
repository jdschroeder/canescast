        <p>Everything to play for in this game as the Canes continue to battle against adversity and work hard to get out of the red and back into the black. Quite frankly all of us Caniacs are praying for an end to this losing streak, and know the boys have it in them to turn this around and start putting numbers in the win column. Never was there been a better opponent to face than Red Deer who served up a 4-1 loss to the Canes in Red Deer when Captain Cam got the only goal for Lethbridge.</p>

<p>The Rebels come to Lethbridge on the back of a 2 game losing streak, which saw them win their previous 6 games giving them a 8-4-0-1 record compared to the Hurricanes 2-12-0-1.
Surely this was the night when we had a couple of defence men returning from illness, we could gain some solidity at the back and allow our top performers to show the guile and skill that has so far served up 35 goals this season. </p>

<p>Tonight also saw the unveiling of the Canes 3rd jersey, a throw back to the classic jersey of their Eastern Conference Winning year, surely that could impart some good luck and push them to their 3rd win of the season... unfortunately, it wasn&#39;t to be as the Red Deer Rebels had too much in reserve for the Canes to gain the upper hand.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6293671650/" title="Braes, Sutter, and Henry by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6031/6293671650_509ece29a0_z.jpg" alt="Braes, Sutter, and Henry"></a></p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>In a penalty filled first, the Canes were quick out of the gates, but couldn&#39;t find the answer to the slick play of the red deer rebels.
The rebels scored on their first power play opportunity after Russ Maxwell was called for slashing. 
Jay Merkley was skating hard and hustling on every shift, forcing several opportunities, but with the rebels cleaning up well in their own zone, he found it hard to find another Hurricane for support.</p>

<p>The Rebels grew in confidence during the period, often pushing their interpretation of the rules, whilst receiving little or no punishment from the officials.
At the end of the first came 3 quick no calls, the last of which looked like the most obvious boarding call I have seen this season when Cam Braes was nailed hard right in front of the ref only for him to ignore the infraction, as he had done with several infringements prior to that play. </p>

<p>The Canes hustled hard during the first, but were always one step behind the with the fast passing play of the rebels. They put up good resistance and showed great tenacity to keep the score at 1-0. </p>

<p>However, the Canes resistance was quickly undone in the last minute when Elson forced the turnover directing the puck towards the Canes blue zone and skating hard to get to the puck first, got a tip to the puck and deflected it past Liston. </p>

<p>A tough break after they played hard and kept the score tight, although the shot clock showed a different story.</p>

<p>Goals: 
1. R.D M. Dumba, (4) (C. Mayor, J. Persson), 8:40 (PP)<br>
1. R.D T. Elson, (4) , 19:09</p>

<p>Penalties: 
1 - R.D T. Elson, 6:35 - Major-Fighting, 5 min
1 - LET S. Galbraith, 6:35 - Major-Fighting, 5 min
1 - LET R. Maxwell, 7:25 - Slashing, 2 min (PP)
1 - R.D C. Mayor, 10:16 - Major-Fighting, 5 min
1 - LET L. Oslanski, 10:16 - Major-Fighting, 5 min
1 - LET S. McKechnie, 11:36 - Holding, 2 min (PP)
1 - LET A. Blomqvist, 12:52 - Checking from Behind, 2 min (PP)
1 - R.D C. Robinson, 16:14 - Tripping, 2 min (PP)</p>

<p>Shots: 5-14.</p>

<p>The second period started with a rousing reception from the Enmax crowd as the refs skated out to start the second, letting them know that they expected a better performance from them from here on in...... they got an almost immediate response after Tyler Kizuik got his stick caught up under his own feet, dropped his stick and got called for tripping, himself.</p>

<p>The rebels increased their lead as Kambeitz gets a tip to a cross ice pass as he sat unmarked at the far post. </p>

<p>The Canes were looking deflated but continued on their high work rate as they registered 14 shots during the second period, whilst skating hard to match the effort of the rebels. In the same period Red Deer registered 18 shots as they caught the Canes on the rush on more than one occasion.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6293626930/" title="Nick Buonassisi by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6042/6293626930_9ae28cb8ae_z.jpg" alt="Nick Buonassisi"></a></p>

<p>Nick Buonassisi is improving with every game and continues to show why he can fill the gap left in the top line with the season long injury to Austin Fyten. A shrewd trade, who will score plenty of goals when the Canes get back to winning ways. </p>

<p>The Red Deer 4th goal showed great stick work from Mayor with a sublime goal as he closed in on Liston and then with quick hands left Liston flat footed scoring on the backhand with a nice deke, beating Liston high blocker side.</p>

<p>Goals:
2. R.D A. Kambeitz, (6) (T. Elson, J. Persson), 6:43<br>
2. R.D C. Mayor, (4) (J. Weller), 8:02</p>

<p>Penalties:
2 - LET T. Kizuik, 0:36 - Tripping, 2 min (PP)
2 - R.D C. Millette, 2:40 - Hooking, 2 min (PP)
2 - R.D J. Cowen, 11:19 - Roughing, 2 min
2 - LET G. Hood, 11:19 - Roughing, 2 min
2 - R.D J. Weller, 12:05 - Tripping, 2 min (PP)
2 - LET R. Maxwell, 19:35 - 10-Minute Misconduct, 10 min
2 - R.D P. Bartosak, 20:00 - Unsportsmanlike Cnd., 2 min
2 - LET S. Galbraith, 20:00 - 10-Minute Misconduct, 10 min</p>

<p>Shots: 19-32.</p>

<p>Spencer Galbraith started the third with a 10 minute GM due to the shenanigans at the end of the 2nd. Another interesting decision when Bartosak, the Rebels goaltender, got 2 minutes for unsportsmanlike conduct at the close of the second period for goading both the crowd and the Hurricanes bench.</p>

<p>The third was a more evenly officiated period as the refs let the players play, giving just one penalty to either side in the final 20 minutes.</p>

<p>The Canes really worked hard to fashion a came back in this period, matching the work rate of the Rebels with both sides registering 10 shots on goal.</p>

<p>However, the task of making up a 4 goal deficit weighed heavily on a team that couldn&#39;t catch a break. Canes conceded another powerplay goal after nice passing across the face of the goal gave Dumba a big target top corner as he hit a slap shot from the face-off circle to the top corner to ensure there was now coming back for the Canes.
The Canes rallied and looked to score at least a consolation goal, but even with good work from Braes, Sutter and  Buonassisi, couldn&#39;t beat the sprawling Bartosak. 
The Rebels continued to press and the Canes were often hemmed into their own zone unable to clear the puck. 
Again goaltender Liam Liston stood on his head to keep the score at 5-0 with the inventive rebels always pressing.</p>

<p>Jay Merkley had another outstanding period after standing out in the first as a real talent, a player who once the team gains some confidence will prove to be an even bigger asset than he is currently. Hitting the side netting several times and playing like a top liner whenever he took to the ice.</p>

<p>Goals:
3. R.D M. Dumba, (5) (C. Mayor), 7:47 (PP)</p>

<p>Penalties:
3 - LET B. Ramsay, 6:49 - Unsportsmanlike Cnd., 2 min (PP)
3 - R.D Served By M. Burr, 10:38 - Too Many Men, 2 min</p>

<p>Shots: 29-42.</p>

<h2>With the man advantage.....</h2>

<p>Canes: 0/3 
Rebels: 2/5</p>

<p>PIM:
Canes: 42 min/ 10 inf
Rebels: 22 min/8 inf</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>The Canes lost this one due to a combination of playing a hungry well organized Rebels team along with a couple of lapses in concentration. 
The losing streak is obviously weighing heavily on the boys as they do everything they can to turn the skid around. A task that is not helped when the officials seem to be watching a different game to the one the occupants of the Enmax saw. Even the otherwise impartial members of the media, were shocked at some of the non calls. 
Don&#39;t be too surprised if the league reviews the hit on Henry after the Red Deer player appeared to target the head of Adam Henry as he hit him hard coming off the bench. 
They may even issue a suspension as the league tries to eliminate the targeting of hits to the head.</p>

<h2><em><a href="http://lethbridgewebdesign.ca">Lethbridge Web Design</a></em> Hardest Working Hurricane:</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6293539651/" title="Jay Merkley by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6101/6293539651_319846cb71_z.jpg" alt="Jay Merkley"></a>
Jay Merkley, generating opportunities, working hard behind the net, but couldn&#39;t quite force one home. Another great addition to the Canes roster that who caused real problems to the opposition and will score a hat full once they start converting these performance into wins. 
Honourable mention to Goaltender Liam Liston who had a 37 save evening and stood on his head to keep the rebels score in single digits.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>Another game full of promise that fell short. It is obvious that the Canes are lacking confidence at the moment, but if they can get back to basics, play to their strengths and get a fully fit group of players together, they will be able to compete, score goals and build on these performances. </p>

<p>It is not that the Canes aren&#39;t hustling, they are giving their all. The difference between a win and a loss, even by a few goals, for the Canes is due in part to lapses in confidence from pretty much a team of rookies who need to find some leadership in defence and turn their opportunities into goals.</p>

<h2>Next up</h2>

<p>The Hurricanes take on the Everett Silvertips back at the Enmax, Wednesday November 2nd. Hopefully a new month will bring new fortune to the Hurricanes who are showing the hard work and determination they need, but need to keep their focus for a full 60 minutes.</p>
