        <p>This post is the first in a series that I will be running this season called <em>Freeze Frames</em>. These articles will provide some insight into the photos I take at Hurricane games throughout the year, highlighting some of my favourites and giving a little bit of narrative along the way.</p>

<p>I would like to acknowledge Seattle Thunderbirds team photographer Kyle Scholzen for unknowingly providing the inspiration to take on this series. I have been following <a href="http://seattlethunderbirdsphoto.wordpress.com/">his blog, entitled Bird Watching</a>, for the last year or so and have very much enjoyed it. I hope that you enjoy my photos as much as I enjoy Kyle&#39;s.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s kick things off with the home opener. Last season&#39;s player introductions produced <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jdschroeder/5064326338/in/set-72157627078877428">one of my favourite photos of the season</a> (As a side note, I&#39;ve been using that photo all year as my iPhone wallpaper. Since Machacek is now a Thunderbird, though, I&#39;ve finally swapped it out with a new one of Sutter). Unfortunately, this year&#39;s player introductions featured no pyrotechnics, fog, or any other particular visual flare; Just the spotlight. I began the evening back by the player entrance, hoping to get a nice dramatic silhouette of a player taking to the ice. The result was far less exciting than I was hoping for.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6200980649/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6029/6200980649_66d46d81df.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>After mostly just getting in the video crew&#39;s way, I decided to head down to the far end of the rink and get ready for the first period. From there I managed to catch the tail end of player introductions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6200981117/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6152/6200981117_7db1f69ab0.jpg" alt="Pre-game player introductions"></a></p>

<p>From there I kept things pretty simple for the first period, shooting from the Zamboni gate. Here we&#39;ve got Albin Blomqvist delivering a hit on a Hitmen player.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6199610656/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6173/6199610656_640196cf88.jpg" alt="Albin Blomqvist delivers a hit along the boards"></a></p>

<p>My favourite shot of the night features Juraj Bezuch celebrating a goal in the first period.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6199610778/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6007/6199610778_6526900d5b.jpg" alt="Juraj Bezuch celebrates a first period goal"></a></p>

<p>Brody Sutter scored a beautiful breakaway goal on a lead pass from Derek Ryckman. Sutter couldn&#39;t help but take a peek at his goal on the new video screen.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6199103963/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6168/6199103963_428e659cfd.jpg" alt="Brody Sutter looks to the video screen for a look at his breakaway goal"></a></p>

<p>Toward the end of the period I headed up to the press box to process a few photos and decided to check out the feasibility of shooting from our seats up there. I think it could work.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6199627914/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6164/6199627914_60ec813f04.jpg" alt="Jaimen Yakubowski defends against a Hitmen player during the first period"></a></p>

<p>The second period was similar positioning, this time with the Hurricanes moving towards me. That set up a few good shots of the d-men, like this one of Reid Jackson unloading a slap shot.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6201531888/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6145/6201531888_b84ed28c9e.jpg" alt="Reid Jackson fires a slap shot"></a></p>

<p>For the third period I headed down to my favourite [off-ice] spot in the rink: the <em>suicide box</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6199414247/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6016/6199414247_d0fbf5cc0d.jpg" alt="Best seat in the house"></a></p>

<p>Among the things I love about shooting from here are being able to hear and feel the game so much more than from anywhere else in the rink. It&#39;s the best place to feel a part of the game. Sometimes you almost do become part of the game. As you can imagine, I was back-peddling as Cam Braes almost came to join me in the box. I&#39;m happy to report that so far I&#39;ve always escaped the box unscathed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6199414343/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6012/6199414343_03a46dc08a.jpg" alt="Cam Braes is hit into the boards near the Hurricanes&#39; bench"></a></p>

<p>Situated right on the red line, there is plenty of action moving towards you.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6201583744/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6169/6201583744_3b959b0a0e.jpg" alt="Brody Sutter"></a></p>

<p>Meanwhile you are also afforded a pretty good look at the goalmouths.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6199501035/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6135/6199501035_3771f2448f.jpg" alt="Macoy Erkamps and Brandon Anderson defend the goal"></a></p>

<p>As a nice finish to the home opener, rookie Jay Merkley was named first star for his two goal performance.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6199473179/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6166/6199473179_d89c98de74.jpg" alt="Rookie Jay Merkley acknowledges the fans after being named first star in his first home game"></a></p>

<p>And how about a bonus shot from the warm-up of Jaimen Yakubowski showing off by juggling a puck on his stick.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6201439426/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6167/6201439426_a07bc1285d.jpg" alt="Jaimen Yakubowski juggles a puck during warm-up"></a></p>

<p>I went a little easier for Saturday&#39;s game against the Pats, but started off with this one from the press box early on.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6201812313/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6179/6201812313_5f6fd1c283.jpg" alt="Brandon Anderson introduced in the pre-game"></a></p>

<p>The shooting angle from the press box makes it more difficult to see faces, but it does open up some nice clean white backgrounds.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6201824413/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6165/6201824413_edf84ffa60.jpg" alt="Craig Leverton carries the puck into Regina territory"></a></p>

<p>We saw a little bit of rough stuff, but no real scraps breaking out in this game.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6201926487/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6152/6201926487_27a9999888.jpg" alt="Adam Henry trades jabs with a Pats player after the whistle"></a></p>

<p>It was good to be back in the rink, taking in the hockey and shooting photos again. I look forward to sharing more with you as the season rolls on.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6200900821/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6162/6200900821_155c1a2913.jpg" alt="Game puck come to rest on the red line"></a></p>
