        <p>With the Canes on a franchise record 11 losses in a row, scoring 1 point in the last 11 games, it was time to turn things around and get back to winning ways. Having played their hearts out in the last game at the Enmax, against the Wheatkings, the Canes were looking to dig deep again and stop the rot. </p>

<p>After coming so close to winning in the last couple of games, we all felt it had to be a matter of time before they could start putting the points on the board.
Unfortunately this wasn&#39;t to be with the Canes suffering too many injuries, not dressing 9 players this evening, combined with facing a talented and hard working team such as the Portland Winterhawks.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>1st Period
The Canes started brightly with rookies, Bezuch, McKechnie and Yakubowski getting lots of ice time, playing like 1st liners in waiting linking up well and putting the Portland Winterhawks under lots of pressure.</p>

<p>Firing out of the gates, the Canes led 6-2 in shots after 5 minutes, looking like a team that meant business.</p>

<p>All that pressure paid off as Sam McKechnie gets the second goal of his WHL career with assists from Nick Buonassisi and Spencer Galbraith, to give the Hurricanes the lead with 7:25 left in the first.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6290136177/" title="Hurricanes goal by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6046/6290136177_00eeffaaa3_z.jpg" width="640" height="425" alt="Hurricanes goal"></a></p>

<p>Portland also had their chances, but goaltender Liam Liston looked strong between the pipes covering his angles well and looking like a safe pair of hands.</p>

<p>Shots: 14-12.</p>

<p>2nd Period</p>

<p>A big second period for Portland saw them score 3 goals unanswered, as the Canes sat back a little letting the opposition skate at them, often getting through on goal with little or no resistance. 
Unfortunately, they suffered the same ailment as they had in other games as they were often guilty of not closing down the opposition, letting them skate right into shooting range firing shots off at will.</p>

<p>Portland tied it up with just over 4 minutes gone in the second as Peters fired one top corner from close in.
The go ahead goal for Portland was simply a communications breakdown with the Canes on the power play, Wrenn puts his stick in, steals the puck and feeds Rattie, who  races through on goal beating Liston with a nice back hand deke.
Two minutes later, Portland wrapped this up as Leisic skated from the halfway line, turned across the hashmarks and fired one into the top corner, blocker side with only Liston to beat.</p>

<p>Canes tried to fight their way back into this, but it was a big ask having taken their foot off the gas after a promising first period. McKechnie tried to fire up his team mates getting into some fistie cuffs with Puliot, but it was a little late in the period to make it count.</p>

<p>Shots: 21-24.</p>

<p>3rd Period</p>

<p>The third started brightly, as the players took to the ice meaning business, trying to make up for a difficult second period.</p>

<p>They showed lots of effort, but the Winterhawks always seemed to have the answer to their efforts, either forcing the save or snuffing out the Canes shots on goal with great defensive work.</p>

<p>A couple of good efforts from Bezuch (again), Ramsay on the breakaway and Braes gave the fans hope, but with nothing too clear cut, it just wasn&#39;t to be the Canes night.</p>

<p>Coach Preston pulled Liston early to try and take advantage of having an extra attacker on the ice, but Portland forced the turnover and Ross skated pretty much the length of the ice to slot it home ensuring another loss for the Canes.</p>

<p>Shots: 31-36.</p>

<p>With the man advantage.....</p>

<p>Canes: 0/4 
Hawks: 0/4</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>The Canes lost this one with an injury ravaged team, to a well seasoned Winterhawks team, that once the Canes took their foot off the gas, skated through them almost at will.</p>

<p>The Canes have to get in tight to the opposing side and give their goaltender some coverage. They need to communicate more on the ice and start making their hard work pay off for them. 
It is not for the lack of effort, but when they went a couple of goals behind tonight, they struggled to find the fight from the past couple of games to really carve out any clear cut chances and get back into this game.</p>

<h2><em><a href="http://lethbridgewebdesign.ca">Lethbridge Web Design</a></em> Hardest Working Hurricane:</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6290572838/" title="Juraj Bezuch by canescast, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6098/6290572838_0be404389f_z.jpg" width="640" height="512" alt="Juraj Bezuch"></a></p>

<p>Juraj Bezuch who really made things buzz on the ice tonight, driving the net, forcing the turnovers, even juggling the puck almost singlehanded into the Portland net, gaining a power play for the Canes in the process as the Winterhawks cleared the puck over the boards for  a delay of game penalty. 
I like the way Juraj plays and think we will see a lot of good stuff from the young slovakian.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>We know that this team can play well as they have shown in the last few games, but they were always going to face an up hill struggle against the Winterhawks, never mind with so many players out injured. We had Brady Ramsay and Captain Cam Braes filling in in defence at times, as the Canes could only dress 4 recognized defence men.</p>

<p>Lethbridge have to tighten up defensively, when they can actually ice a full compliment of defensive lines that is, and keep playing for 60 minutes if they are going to turn this around any time soon. </p>

<h2>Next up</h2>

<p>The Hurricanes take on the Red Deer Rebels back at the Enmax in Saturday night as they continue to search for the answer to their defensive frailties and big time injury problems. 
We know there is a win coming, we just hope it happens soon so the Canes can gain some confidence and try to get something out of a season that promised so much a couple of games in.</p>
