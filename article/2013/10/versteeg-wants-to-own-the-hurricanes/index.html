        <p>On the heels of a heartbreaking overtime defeat to the Moose Jaw Warriors last night, the Lethbridge Hurricanes ownership has taken the spotlight. During the off-season rumours surfaced about a group including former players having an interest in purchasing the team. The change of direction behind the bench seemed to quiet those rumours. Until now.</p>

<p>The summer’s rumours never included any names, but Kris Versteeg would invariably be mentioned in any speculation, given his connection to the team and city. Today we got confirmation of that by way of <a href="http://lethbridgeherald.com/sports/hurricanes/2013/10/versteeg-writes-open-letter-to-fans-shareholders/">an open letter published in the Lethbridge Herald</a>.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='“I, and the people involved alongside me, have the best interests of the Lethbridge Hurricanes at heart and want to make the organization a successful WHL hockey club.”'>
Versteeg emphasized that he did not intend to kick the Hurricanes while they are down, but the strong implication is that he feels his group are better suited to icing a winner than the current community-ownership: “I, and the people involved alongside me, have the best interests of the Lethbridge Hurricanes at heart and want to make the organization a successful WHL hockey club.”
</span></p>

<p>Versteeg concedes that “ultimately, the future of this team is up to the shareholders,” and indeed, the board’s insistence over the summer that they were not interested in a sale indicates that having a willing seller may be the biggest obstacle to Versteeg and his group. However, if the board’s disinterest in listening to offers is not shared by a majority of shareholders, it could well become a contentious issue within the current ownership group.</p>

<p>The greatest advantage of maintaining a community-ownership model is the assurance that the team will not easily relocate, and with a smaller market like Lethbridge, that threat of relocation is always looming when financial losses mount. As far as private ownership goes, though, having Kris Versteeg leading the charge may be as safe from relocation as community-ownership. The former Hurricane who calls Lethbridge home has an interest in keeping the team here, and that may bode well for his chances of convincing shareholders to consider a sale. As he points out, Versteeg has remained an active participant in the local hockey community since becoming an NHLer, and that local-focus should be re-assuring to shareholders considering giving up their ownership.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='the team is not for sale and the club has not be approached with any official offers'>
While the letter has caused considerable buzz among fans this morning, Paul Kingsmith of Global Lethbridge <a href="https://twitter.com/paulkingsmith/status/393779503245189120">points out an important point on Twitter</a>, noting that as of right now the team is not for sale and the club has not be approached with any official offers. He also points out that the WHL’s involvement in franchise sales means that if the Hurricanes were for sale, there is no assurance that Versteeg’s group would be the successful buyer, as we saw when some Saskatoon alumni were unsuccessful in buying the Blades this year. The WHL also has a less than stellar record when it comes to staying committed to local fanbases, <a href="http://www.theprogress.com/sports/119043299.html">as WHL fans in</a> <a href="http://www.theprogress.com/sports/120330824.html">Chilliwack will tell you</a>.
</span></p>

<p>So, before you get too excited about the prospect of the Hurricanes entering a glorious new era under Versteeg’s direction, consider that the Hurricanes could just as easily end up sold to business interests in Vancouver, or sold to True North and relocated to Winnipeg. It’s a fun exercise to consider what could be, but don’t get your hopes up just yet.</p>
