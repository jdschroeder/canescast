        <p>During the second period of Thursday night’s game against he Calgary, the Hitmen scored a controversial goal that tied the game at 1-1. Pavel Padakin fired a shot from just in front of the goal line, sneaking it between Corbin Boes and the goalpost. It looked like a goal scorer’s goal until we got a second look at it, at which point it didn’t look like a goal at all. Let’s take a look at it, frame-by-frame.</p>

<p>In the first frame here you’ll see Boes’ crease area, but no puck yet. Padakin has just fired his shot from off screen, and the puck will later enter the frame from the top.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.canescast.ca/web/goal-review-0.png" alt="Frame 0"></p>

<p>You will now notice a dark streak come into the frame in front of Boes. That’s the puck coming toward the net.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.canescast.ca/web/goal-review-1.png" alt="Frame 1"></p>

<p>We now lose sight of the puck for a few frames.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.canescast.ca/web/goal-review-2.png" alt="Frame 2"></p>

<p><img src="http://media.canescast.ca/web/goal-review-3.png" alt="Frame 3"></p>

<p>Still no sign of the puck in the fifth frame, but something to take note of here is that Boes makes contact with the near post, jarring the net slightly. This will be more noticeable when you see it animated in a moment.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.canescast.ca/web/goal-review-4.png" alt="Frame 4"></p>

<p>In the sixth frame, the puck has re-appeared, making contact with the far goalpost.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.canescast.ca/web/goal-review-5.png" alt="Frame 5"></p>

<p>And in the next two frames, the puck is clearly moving away from the net.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.canescast.ca/web/goal-review-6.png" alt="Frame 6"></p>

<p><img src="http://media.canescast.ca/web/goal-review-7.png" alt="Frame 7"></p>

<p>Here they are all strung together.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.canescast.ca/web/goal-review-animated.gif" alt="Animated"></p>

<p>Here’s my guess as to why the video review took so long, and why it was eventually ruled a goal. First, and imperatively here, the ruling on the ice was that this was a goal, so the video evidence had to conclusively show that a goal was not scored in order to overturn that call. There are two factors that I think can cause this to be inconclusive. The first being that we lose sight of the puck for a couple of frames worth of action. Best guess is that for at least one of those, the puck is obscured by the crossbar, but it’s hard to tell for sure, especially since this particular footage isn’t a high frame rate, so the fast moving puck turns into a blur pretty easily. We don’t really know where the puck is at all for a split second there.</p>

<p>The second factor that I think could cast some doubt here is the camera angle over the net. The goal line and the crossbar are both visible with the crossbar appearing immediately behind the goal line. In reality, the crossbar is directly above the goal line, so we have a bit of a parallax happening here.</p>

<p>The illustration below demonstrates how the camera position above the net can make it appear as though a puck is directly beneath the crossbar, when in fact it has crossed the plane of the goal line. The red blocks at the top are the crossbar, the red blocks at the bottom are the goal line. The dotted line is the plane of the goal line that the puck must cross to score a goal, the the pink line is the area obscured from the overhead camera by the crossbar.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.canescast.ca/web/goal-review-parallax.png" alt="Parallax"></p>

<p>The lesson here: If you can see the goal line and the crossbar at the same time and the puck is obscured by the crossbar, you can’t conclusively make a call based on that angle of view.</p>

<p>When it gets right down to it, I still don‘t believe that the puck crossed the goal line. It’s hard to imagine a direct hit and roll off the post having actually crossed the line. That said, based on the video evidence that I have available, I don’t think I can make a case to conclusively overturn the call, either, so I may have to concede that the video goal judge made an appropriate call in allowing the goal to stand.</p>
