        <p>Once or twice I’ve found myself at the end of training camp, sitting across the table from a coach or general manager. Without fail, they always made sure to remind me that cutting players was the worst part of their job. I suppose even though the decision to cut <em>me</em> was easy, breaking that news to a player can still be unpleasant. Sometimes, though, a team has to make a genuinely difficult decision to part ways with a player. This season the Hurricanes faced just that situation.</p>

<p>Roster turnover is a reality of junior hockey. No player is able to spend more than five seasons in the league, while twenty year olds and import players are further restricted by quotas. The progression of graduating players coupled with the influx of new talent means that inevitably difficult personnel decisions will have to be made. Sometimes, you have to part ways with good players.</p>

<p>The Hurricanes made this decision with two players in particular this season; players who were known not just for their play on the ice, but also their character and community involvement. Twenty year old Michael Sofillas was released, and signed on with the Manitoba Junior Hockey League’s Dauphin Kings. Depth forward Craig Leverton was later traded to the Prince Albert Raiders.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/8011416646/'><img alt='Michael Sofillas' src='http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8451/8011416646_7f55b7db9d.jpg'></a></p>

<p>Michael Sofillas cracked the Hurricanes’ roster full time in 2010-2011, a season in which he would be named the team’s scholastic player of the year and fan favourite. Unfortunately, he also suffered a concussion that kept him out of the entire following season. Making his return last year, Sofillas earned plenty of respect for his dedication and perseverance, and of course, the The Joan Kobal Memorial Award for Perseverance, Dedication, and Sportsmanship. In his return season, Sofillas also showcased his versatility, filling in as a defenceman when injuries plagued the blue line.</p>

<p>GM Brad Robson called Sofillas “a character player both on and off the ice,” and the outpouring of comments from Hurricane fans (and media) on Twitter echoed the sentiment.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Sofillas15">@Sofillas15</a> You&#39;re a class act Michael! Going to miss seeing you on the ice.

<p>Craig Leverton was selected by the Hurricanes early in the second round of the 2010 WHL Bantam Draft. In two seasons with the Hurricanes he tallied 12 goals and 17 assists through 103 games. Although his offensive output was relatively modest, his attitude made an impression. As Robson was quoted in the team’s press release announcing the trade, Leverton was considered “a dedicated worker, who has a positive attitude and works hard every shift ... also very community oriented and takes his role as a hockey player and member of the community seriously.” </p>

<p>Last season Leverton was named the Hurricanes Scholastic Player of the Year, and also went out of his way to <a href="http://www.lethbridgehurricanes.com/article/chuck-a-puck-at-tonight-s-canes-game">help out his best friend with an in-game chuck-a-puck fundraiser</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve heard it said by junior hockey clubs that they aim to do more than just develop hockey players; They want to contribute to the community and develop their players into young men who make a positive contribution to society. If Michael Sofillas and Craig Leverton are any indication, the Hurricanes are succeeding at doing just that.</p>

<p>When Brad Robson informed these players that the Hurricanes were parting ways with them, I’m sure he told them what a difficult decision it was for the team. In this case, I believe him.</p>
