        <p>Tonight kicks off the start of the Lethbridge Hurricanes’ 2013-2014 regular season schedule. Plenty of change and excitement surrounds this team heading into the new season. As always, making the playoffs will be easier said than done in the WHL’s central division.</p>

<h2>The Divisional Rivals</h2>

<p>With so many games played against each divisional opponent, the Hurricanes will need to find success against familiar foes in order to keep themselves in the thick of the contenders.</p>

<p>The Edmonton Oil Kings have been the team to beat as Eastern Conference champions the past two seasons, but departures like goaltender Laurent Brossoit should see them come back down to earth again. This is still a team with plenty of star power, though, Tristan Jarry can handle the starting role in net. It will be a big boost the Oil Kings if and when the Islanders return Griffin Reinhart as well.</p>

<p>In Calgary, the Hitmen are a team that always seems in the hunt. Chris Driedger and Mack Shields return in goal, while Jake Virtanen is an offensive star on the rise, and a presumptive first round pick in next year’s NHL entry draft.</p>

<p>The Red Deer Rebels could return to the top of the division this year. Twenty year old Lukas Sutter will hope to rebound from a disappointing downturn in production last year in Saskatoon. In goal, Patrik Bartosak has the ability to steal games on any given night, so his return from the LA Kings makes a huge difference for the Rebels. They can also hope for defenceman Matt Dumba to be returned from the Minnesota Wild, injecting a top end powerplay quarterback into the lineup. Conner Bleackley and Haydn Fleury had strong rookie seasons last year and will look to be the future of the Rebels.</p>

<p>Out in Cranbrook, the Kootenay Ice are lead by captain and potential top NHL entry draft prospect Sam Reinhart. The Ice found themselves in the number ten spot in the CHL’s season opening top ten rankings, although concensus seems to be that a national top ten spot for the Ice is being generous. That said, the Ice do have quality goaltending with Mackenzie Skapski returning in goal. This team probably goes about as far as Reinhart can carry them, though.</p>

<p>The highway 3 rival Medicine Hat Tigers added some depth in goal this week, adding Daniel Wapple from the Moose Jaw Warriors. I’m not convinced that he or Marek Langhamer is in the same class as some of the proven goaltenders in this division, so that may be the weak spot for the Tigers this year. In all likelihood, the Tigers will have Hunter Shinkaruk returned from the Vancouver Canucks. Much like the Kootenay will rely on Reinhart, so will Medicine Hat rely on Shinkaruk’s goal scoring ability. Another player to watch may be eighteen year old Tommy Vannelli who has left the Minnesota Golden Gophers and is expected to join the Tigers.</p>

<p>All-in-all, the Central looks to be a strong division this season. For Drake Berehowski’s Hurricanes, that means not taking any nights off, because none of these teams can be taken lightly. Playing 32 of their 72 games happening within the division, the ability to compete directly with these opponents could make or break the Hurricanes’ season. Fortunately for Hurricane fans, I don’t think Berehowski knows a thing about taking nights off.</p>

<hr>

<p>The action gets underway tonight at the Enmax Centre. Tickets are available from the Ticket Centre at (403)329-SEAT or in person at the Enmax Centre. A tailgate party gets underway at 4:30 ahead of the 7:00 start against the Tigers.</p>
