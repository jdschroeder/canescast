        <p>Nobody can accuse this year’s Lethbridge Hurricanes of being boring. After a bumpy start to the year in last weekend’s home-and-home with the Tigers, the Hurricanes showed some third period spark in a pair of games this weekend, taking three of a possible four points on the road.</p>

<p>After being contained and outplayed for 40 minutes in Cranbrook on Friday night, the Hurricanes came to life in the third period, striking three times with the man advantage to force overtime before falling to the Ice in a shootout, 4-3. A similar storyline played out in Edmonton on Sunday afternoon when the Oil Kings took a 2-1 lead through two periods, outshooting the Hurricanes 37-13. A 42 second three goal outburst gave the ‘Canes all the offence they would need to get into the win column for the first time of the season. Russ Maxwell added an empty-netter in a 5-3 win.</p>

<p>The latest in a line of twenty year old Hurricane goalies, Corbin Boes has so far looked every bit as good as Ty Rimmer before him through two games. While facing 89 shots, Boes has made 83 saves, posting a 2.88 goals against average and .933 save percentage. Those are encouraging numbers that indicate the veteran ‘keeper has not been set back by the off-season surgery that kept him out of training camp.</p>

<p>The concern may be the early season shots on goal trend. Generally speaking, teams who register more shots on goal tend to score more goals. Teams who are outshot by an average of sixteen goals a game are probably going to find themselves on the losing end of things more often than not. That’s where the Hurricanes find themselves after two weekends, being outshot 164-99 so far, or a 41-25 per-game average. Exceptional goaltending can steal some wins, but even then Boes is going to need some more support than Hurricane goalies have been seeing so far.</p>

<p>Head coach Drake Berehowski has repeatedly emphasized discipline as one of the characteristics that would identify his team. So far, though, his players have had a tough time staying out of the penalty box. The Hurricanes have found themselves shorthanded 22 times through the first four games, and have a middle-of-the-pack 77.3% success rate on the penalty kill.</p>

<p>It’s clear there are some growing pains to overcome as this still young group adapts to the new coaching staff’s system. At the same time, a strong showing by a veteran netminder and the resiliency to fight back in the final twenty minutes in consecutive games are positive indicators of what is possible for the Hurricanes this season.</p>

<p>Next action for the ‘Canes is Wednesday, October 2, a 7:00 start at the Enmax Centre against the Calgary Hitmen.</p>
