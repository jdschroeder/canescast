        <p>There’s been a fair bit of action on the Hurricane front since our last post, so let’s get caught up with a weekend recap.</p>

<h2>Prospect signings</h2>

<p>Prior to the end of training camp, the Hurricanes inked three prospects to WHL player agreements, including defencemen Brandon Kennedy and Kade Jensen, both drafted in 2012, and 2013 first round draft pick, goaltender Stuart Skinner. Ten rookies from training camp were then announced as continuing with the club into the pre-season. On forward the Hurricanes kept Giorgio Estephan, Kolten Olynek, Reid Nemeth, Zach Goberis, and Carter Amson, while keeping Bryton Sayers, Brandon Kennedy, Kade Jensen, and Thomas Lenchyshyn on defence, and Jonny Hogue in goal.</p>

<h2>Sofillas released</h2>

<p><a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/8273219893/'><img alt='Michael Sofillas at the bench during a time-out' src='http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8362/8273219893_0860ef463b.jpg'></a></p>

<p>The quota for twenty year olds claimed it’s first victim when the Hurricanes announced on September 1 that Michael Sofillas was being released. Sofillas, as you likely recall, has battled injury through his WHL career, missing the entire 2012-2013 season while suffering from a concussion. He earned praise for a determined comeback to the team last season, and proved himself as a useful two-way center, versatile enough to fill-in on defence when injuries left vacancies on the blue line.</p>

<p>In a show of his character, Sofillas left a parting thank you message to the Hurricane organization and fans in the Lethbridge Herald:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Did you see the <a href="https://twitter.com/Leth_Herald">@Leth_Herald</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23yql&amp;src=hash">#yql</a>? What a GREAT way to wake up! <a href="https://twitter.com/Sofillas15">@Sofillas15</a> you are a gem, thank you for 4 great yrs <a href="http://t.co/N6b7iUVp3r">pic.twitter.com/N6b7iUVp3r</a></p>&mdash; LethbridgeHurricanes (@WHLHurricanes) <a href="https://twitter.com/WHLHurricanes/statuses/375965681579065344">September 6, 2013</a></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Sofillas has now <a href="http://www.dauphinkings.com/farticle.php?article_id=280">joined the Dauphin Kings</a> of Manitoba’s Junior A league. We wish him all the best in the future.</p>

<h2>Hurricanes kick off the pre-season</h2>

<p>The ‘Canes got the pre-season rolling in Taber against the Calgary Hitmen on Thursday night. Reid Duke tallied a goal and two assists, while Jonny Hogue went the distance between the pipes in a 7-4 victory.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the Hurricanes headed north to visit the Red Deer Rebels. Recently signed goaltending prospect Stuart Skinner got the start in goal, playing half the game and stopping all 23 shots directed his way. Reid Nemeth tallied the only Hurricane goal in a 2-1 shootout loss.</p>

<p>The next pre-season action goes 7:00 on Wednesday night at the Enmax Centre as the Hurricanes host the Medicine Hat Tigers. Tickets are $10 and can be purchased from Lethbridge Minor Hockey or at the door.</p>

<h2>NHL Prospect Tournaments</h2>

<p>Several current and former Hurricanes were taking part in the recent NHL prospect tournaments over the weekend as well. In Penticton, BC, <strong>Axel Blomqvist</strong> put in a strong performance with the Winnipeg, scoring twice in three games. <strong>Josh Derko</strong> appeared in three games for the San Jose Sharks in the same tournament, managing three shots on goal. Meanwhile, several former Hurricanes also played in the tournament, as <strong>Austin Fyten</strong> picked up an assist with the Edmonton Oilers prospects and <strong>Dan Johnston</strong> scored a game winning goal for the Vancouver Canucks. <strong>Ty Rimmer</strong> also joined the Oilers, although he didn’t see any game action.</p>

<p>In London, Ontario’s prospect tournament, <strong>Adam Henry</strong> suited up for the Chicago Blackhawks and tallied a goal.</p>

<h2>Face Off Against Cancer</h2>

<p>For 24 hours from Friday evening until Saturday evening, more than 80 players took to the ice after raising pledges to benefit the Canadian Cancer Society. Hurricane coach Drake Berehowski played in the first hour of the game while a number of his players, including Sam Mckechnie, Spencer Galbraith, and Remi Laurencelle took Berehowski’s place behind the bench. In the end, $27,000 was raised for the Cancer Society. </p>

<p>I’ll leave you with a look at the action from Face Off Against Cancer where you will see this CanesCaster chasing down a puck after making a bad pinch at the blue line:</p>
