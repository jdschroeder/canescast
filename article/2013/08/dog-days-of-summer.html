        <p>It’s been a quiet summer here on CanesCast.ca, but things have been anything but slow for the Lethbridge Hurricanes since last season ended. With training camp only a few weeks away now, we’ve got some catching up to do.</p>

<h2>Preston out, Berehowski in</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/8345189544/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8080/8345189544_9f94510185_z.jpg" alt="Rich Preston and Matt Kabayama"></a></p>

<p>Perhaps the summer’s biggest news came shortly after the season ended, when the Hurricanes relieved head coach and general manager Rich Preston of his duties after four years behind the bench. Replacing Preston as bench boss is former NHL defenceman Drake Berehowski who joins the team after spending a season as head coach and general manager of the ECHL’s expansion Orlando Solar Bears. Two time Stanley Cup winner Brad Lukowich was later introduced as assistant coach, replacing associate coach Matt Kabayama whose contract was not renewed. Previously the assistant general manager, Brad Robson becomes the Hurricanes’ general manager.</p>

<h2>Bantam and import drafts</h2>

<p>Robson is no stranger to the scouting and drafting process, but he got his first opportunity to put his own mark on the future of the franchise with the WHL Bantam Draft in early May. Interestingly enough, his first move was strikingly similar to a common strategy during Preston’s tenure: acquiring a 20 year old goaltender. The Hurricanes sent the 6th overall pick in the Bantam draft to the Brandon Wheat Kings for goalie Corbin Boes and the 17th overall draft pick that was then used to select another goalie, Stuart Skinner from SSAC Edmonton.</p>

<p>In July the Hurricanes used the 20th overall selection in the CHL import draft to select 6&#39;2&quot; 188lb Belarussian defenceman Kristian Khenkel.</p>

<h2>Galbraith’s return?</h2>

<p>Spencer Galbraith has made a couple of mentions on Twitter about returning to Lethbridge (<a href="https://twitter.com/SpennyGG/status/337223348184563712">here</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SpennyGG/status/355411188768714752">here</a>). While the added grit and experience coming back to the blue line would be a positive, don’t consider him a lock to make the team, since his return likely means five over age players reporting to camp (Ramsay, Sofillas, Derko, and Boes being the other four).</p>

<h2>New logo unveiled</h2>

<p>An ongoing story throughout the season was how the NHL was requiring that the Hurricanes alter their branding so as to not borrow so heavily from the Washington Capitals. The anticipation was almost too much to bear, but finally in June we got to see the new logo and uniforms that the Hurricanes will sport this season.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/9037868824/"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5536/9037868824_382caf439e_z.jpg" alt="Jamal Watson and a Lethbridge Minor Hockey player model the new uniforms"></a></p>

<p>The Hurricanes also entered into an agreement with Lethbridge Minor Hockey that will see the local teams share the Hurricanes’ name and logo.</p>

<h2>Canes players at NHL development camps</h2>

<p>The Hurricanes may have been shut out at the NHL entry draft, but they didn’t go unnoticed by NHL scouts. Macoy Erkamps attended development camp with the Ottawa Senators, while Jaimen Yakubowski got to show his stuff for the Detroit Red Wings. Axel Blomqvist <a href="https://twitter.com/AxelBlomqvist/status/364872670485024768">has since Tweeted</a> that he has signed an amateur try-out agreement with the Winnipeg Jets and will attend their training camp.</p>

<h2>Pilon strikes gold at Ivan Hlinka tournament</h2>

<p>Finally, Ryan Pilon and Reid Duke were invited to Team Canada’s U18 selection camp for the Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament. Despite good reviews of his camp, Duke did not crack the final roster. Pilon, however, did represent Canada at the annual tournament in the Czech Republic, and helped Canada to a sixth consecutive gold medal win. Hurricane list player Chase Phelps was part of the American team that took silver. Congratulations to both of them on a good showing.</p>

<p>That gets us pretty much caught up on the news of the summer. Hockey season is sneaking up on us, so start thinking about those <a href="http://www.lethbridgehurricanes.com/page/season-tickets">season tickets</a> if you haven’t done so already. It’s going to be a fun season with the new look Hurricanes.</p>
