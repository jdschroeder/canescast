        <h1>Three Players to Watch</h1>

        <p>Now that I’ve finally come to a sense of closure on the Rich Preston era, it’s time to look forward with optimism on the upcoming season. There are three players that I am keen to see in action this season, because I think they are capable of greater than we’ve seen from them. Here is my short list of three returning players to watch on the Hurricanes this season.</p>

<h2>1. Reid Duke</h2>

<p>Last season it seemed like every night Reid would do something magnificent, showcasing his speed and puck handling abilities. He just seemed snakebitten when it came to finishing his opportunities, though, and as a result he seemed to be working with limited ice time. While 24 points in 57 games was good enough for 25th in rookie scoring, it was likely below the expectations that Duke had for himself as a highly touted prospect. Combine the fact that Duke was left off the roster for Canada’s entry to the Ivan Hlinka Memorial U18 tournament this summer with the timing of this being his first year of NHL draft eligibility, and the sophomore will be playing with something to prove this season. Duke has shown time and again that he has the ability to be an elite player in the WHL, and a fresh perspective from a young, energetic coaching staff will hopefully have a positive influence on him. Add it all up, and I expect Duke to have a substantial impact this season.</p>

<h2>2. Adam Henry</h2>

<p><a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/8323699589/'><img alt='Adam Henry' src='http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8498/8323699589_4d0d3b56fd.jpg'></a></p>

<p>Last summer Henry was diagnosed with an inflammation of the heart, a condition known as myocarditis. As a result, the defenceman was kept from intense training during the off-season and missed the first half of the 2012-2013 season. Even when he returned, it was apparent that Henry had missed training camp, and it took him a few weeks to get back to game speed. Making matters worse, this all happened in Henry’s draft year, limiting the number of quality opportunities scouts had to evaluate him. This season Henry will be looking to return to the promising form shown before he was shut down last summer. Building on the opportunity that he has at the Chicago Blackhawks’ training camp this fall, I expect he’s going to be highly motivated coming into the season. </p>

<h2>3. Axel Blomqvist</h2>

<p><a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/8344097499/'><img alt='Axel Blomqvist' src='http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8221/8344097499_560504355c.jpg'></a></p>

<p>One of my favourite comments on Twitter all last season was from Anton Blomqvist, the older brother of Axel and Albin:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Did that just really happened? <a href="https://twitter.com/AxelBlomqvist">@AxelBlomqvist</a> backchecked and hit a guy in the same shift. I like what <a href="https://twitter.com/WHLHurricanes">@WHLHurricanes</a> have done to him <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dub&amp;src=hash">#dub</a></p>&mdash; Anton Blomqvist (@blomqvistA) <a href="https://twitter.com/blomqvistA/statuses/260915726204956672">October 24, 2012</a></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I think that kind of sums up the kind of season it was for Axel as he adapted to North American hockey. It was obviously a change of style for him, and at times he didn’t look totally acclimated to the league. With a year of WHL experience and an upcoming training camp with the Winnipeg Jets, Blomqvist should be more comfortable in his role and be able to better apply his size and skill to build upon his team-leading 33 point rookie campaign.</p>

<p>There are others who should be fun to watch this year as well, like Ryan Pilon and Macoy Erkamps and their continued development, as well as newly acquired goalkeeper Corbin Boes. Untapped potential and interest from the NHL make Duke, Henry, and Blomqvist are the most intriguing to me, though.</p>
