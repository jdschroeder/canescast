        <p>In the summer of 2009, just a year removed from an appearance in the WHL finals, the Hurricanes opted not to renew head coach Michael Dyck, while also cutting ties with general manager Roy Stasiuk. Rich Preston, coming off of a five season stint as an assistant coach with the Calgary Flames, was hired to fill both vacant positions. Before we turn our focus toward the new season ahead, I thought I would take one final look at the Hurricanes’ performance over the four seasons under the performance of Rich Preston.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Preston won 100 contests, while losing 156 in regulation, and another 32 in overtime or shootouts'>
Tasked with a rebuild, Preston was aggressive in moving valuable assets for future value, particularly in the case of Carter Ashton, whose trade to Regina (along with Craig Orfino) brought Graham Hood and the draft picks used to select Ryan Pilon and Macoy Erkamps. Indeed, the area where Preston seemed most capable was player acquisition. The on-ice results, however, lagged well behind expectations. Through 288 games coached in Lethbridge, Preston won 100 contests, while losing 156 in regulation, and another 32 in overtime or shootouts. Over the course of the past two seasons, patience was wearing thin among fans, and evidently on the board as well. On March 26th, Preston was relieved of his duties.
</span></p>

<p>Despite a talented group of players, the results never seemed to follow for the Hurricanes under Preston. What went wrong? I have a few ideas:</p>

<h2>1. Top prospects falling short of expectations</h2>

<p>With the third overall draft pick in the 2010 bantam draft, Preston selected centre Jay Merkley who posted more than two points per game in Bantam AAA. During the 2011 home opener, Merkley scored twice and was named first star. By all accounts, Merkley was set to usher in the first wave of the Hurricanes’ rebuild. In the following season and a half, Merkley gradually became the poster boy for unmet expectations, eventually being dealt to Swift Current at the 2013 trade deadline. More recently, 2011 fifth overall pick Reid Duke was mired in what seemed like a season-long slump last year.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/8166112485/'><img alt='Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo' src='http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8349/8166112485_601454f4b8.jpg'></a></p>

<p>At times it seemed like these skill players were being deployed in checking roles and given limited ice time. With assignments allowing them to better utilize their skills, it isn’t hard to imagine both Merkley and Duke to be more offensively productive. Duke will have the benefit of a new coaching staff and a new set of systems that may better foster his abilities. </p>

<h2>2. Poor development of goaltending prospects</h2>

<p>There is a lengthy list of goaltenders who have worked the Hurricane crease during Preston’s tenure, but few have managed to play more than a handful of games. Ville Kolppanen, Michael Tadjdeh, Brandon Anderson, Tanner Kovacs, and Liam Liston all failed to develop into dependable starters in Lethbridge and were quickly dispatched or shuffled behind twenty year old veteran off-season acquisitions.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6201584194/'><img alt='Brandon Anderson prepares for the third period' src='http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6172/6201584194_b9179e872d.jpg'></a></p>

<p>I often got the impression that Preston did little to build the confidence of his young goaltenders, highlighted by such games as the Pink in the Rink blowout against Prince Albert in 2010 when Anderson played all 60 minutes, facing 48 shots in a 9-3 drubbing. Preston himself seemed to lose faith in Anderson after the season, and the former starting goalie was supplanted by Damien Ketlo for the 2011-2012 season. Even Christopher Tai, who earned the backup position behind Ty Rimmer last season was used very sparingly, so much so that his development may well have been better served playing at a lower level in order to see more game action.</p>

<p>Even now, the Hurricanes enter the coming season with twenty year old Corbin Boes atop the depth chart. For the sake of developing a future starter, let’s hope Drake Berehowski doesn’t give Boes 65 starts.</p>

<h2>3. Little impact from import draft selections</h2>

<p>While Preston found success mining talent from the bantam draft, he struggled to find gems in the CHL import draft. Particularly in his first two drafts, Preston struck out with picks on Finnish goaltender Ville Koppanen, and Russian forward Alex Kuvaev. In Axel and Albin Blomqvist, and Juraj Bezuch, the Hurricanes added WHL-ready players, but none have had a major impact the way Juha Metsola and Luca Sbisa did before them. Now this may be more an extension of the first two points rather than a problem of drafting. Kuvaev and Bezuch, in particular, showed remarkable raw skill which may have been deployed inappropriately, while Kolppanen and Albin Blomqvist both battled injuries throughout their brief WHL careers. Axel has the tools to succeed at the North American game and may yet become an impact player.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6290270467/'><img alt='Juraj Bezuch breaks in on a scoring chance' src='http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6237/6290270467_ae527dd3b7.jpg'></a></p>

<p>Regardless of the potential shown by Hurricane imports, players like Martin Gernat, Tim Bozon, Andrey Makarov, Alessio Bertaggia, and Patrik Bartosak were passed over by the Hurricanes, and have become premier players in the WHL. The limited import positions were not well utilized under Preston’s guidance.</p>

<p>It would be unfair to pin the Hurricanes’ failure to return to the post-season in the last four years entirely on Rich Preston. Hockey is a team game, after all, and the players are responsible for on-ice execution. However, hockey is also a results-driven business, and even when tasked with a complete rebuild, four years is a long time for a team to go without producing results.</p>

<p>The Hurricanes’ new coaching staff has the benefit of Preston’s drafting and player acquisition. Make better use of their skilled forwards and imports while successfully developing goaltending prospects will go a long way towards building the franchise as a contending team for the near future.</p>
