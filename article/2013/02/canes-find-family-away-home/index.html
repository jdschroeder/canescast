        <p>It&rsquo;s just a part of being a junior hockey player. A handful of players are lucky enough to play close to home, and enjoy the support of family and friends at home and the rink. Many more move away at a young age to chase a dream. With so much of the year spent away from home, opportunities to spend time with family can be few and far between. Lethbridge Hurricane players enjoyed one such opportunity this past weekend, welcoming parents and siblings to celebrate Family Day together.</p>

<p>If you ask ten hockey players who has had the biggest impact on their career, nine of them will probably tell you it has been a parent. This comes as no surprise, given the hours of driving, and sitting in cold arenas that hockey parents endure, not to mention the associated financial burden. Hockey is an expensive game, both in terms of time and money, and if a player has gotten as far as the WHL, he has likely enjoyed the support of very dedicated hockey parents. Leaving that familial support behind can be difficult for both the player and his parents.</p>

<p>Such is the case for the Sofillas family, Komnino and Wendi, and their son Michael. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re at every practice, every game,&rdquo; says Wendi, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s part of your every day life. When you live far apart, you realize it&rsquo;s not part of your life anymore, but it&rsquo;s still his.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/8344226751/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8357/8344226751_fc38a0e990.jpg" alt="Michael Sofillas"></a><br>
<small>Michael Sofillas is one of three Manitobans currently playing for the Hurricanes</small></p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='you know you want to be playing junior hockey in the best junior hockey league in the world, but it&rsquo;s still tough to leave your family and friends behind'>
Take a look at the Hurricanes&rsquo; roster and you&#x27;ll see hometowns scattered across the western provinces (not to mention Osby, Sweden). With the exception of Magrath&rsquo;s Russ Maxwell, Hurricane players are all living at least several hours away from home. For Sofillas, there are fourteen hours separating him from Morden, Manitoba. &ldquo;You move away and it&rsquo;s a struggle,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of those things, you look forward to it, you know you want to be playing junior hockey in the best junior hockey league in the world, but it&rsquo;s still tough to leave your family and friends behind.&rdquo;
</span></p>

<p>Admittedly, staying in touch is easier now than ever before, thanks to the internet. &ldquo;With Facebook and FaceTime and all the technologies, it&#x27;s different than the first year when we didn&#x27;t have any of that,&rdquo; says Wendi. Niclas Blomqvist, like many parents, watches his sons Albin and Axel by following along on the WHL&rsquo;s online video service. &ldquo;Normally we follow them on TV on the internet, so we sit up all night [to watch the game at 3:00 am].&rdquo; It&rsquo;s still no substitute for being there, though. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big difference seeing them live. It&rsquo;s fantastic.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/8344097499/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8221/8344097499_560504355c.jpg" alt="Axel Blomqvist"></a><br>
<small>Niclas Blomqvist enjoyed the rare opportunity to see son Axel play live last weekend</small></p>

<p>The distance can seem even farther when injuries are keeping a player out of the line-up, something that the Sofillas family has endured. Reflecting on the time he&rsquo;s missed to injury Sofillas says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough to go through stuff like that without the support of your immediate family.&rdquo; Was his mom worried? After a telling pause, &ldquo;I&#x27;m a nurse, so a little bit &hellip; It was very difficult at first, because you worry about the future, too, not just the moment.&rdquo; Blomqvist has gone through the same thing. &ldquo;Moving over [from Sweden] to Canada, and Calgary, and Lethbridge, it&rsquo;s far. Especially when Albin got injured, you feel it&rsquo;s far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, the players are taken in by billets. More than just providing a place to live, billets become like adopted families for the players. &ldquo;[Michael] lives with a wonderful family,&rdquo; says Wendi, &ldquo;They treat him like a son, as all the billet families do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They become our second family,&rdquo; confirms Sofillas, &ldquo;They definitely make life easy for us when we come here &hellip; Hats off to all the billets, because they really do make it easy for you to move away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blomqvist echoes the refrain, calling his sons&rsquo; billets <em>fantastic</em>. &ldquo;They have taken so good care of the boys, and I think they fit in good with the family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wendi and Komnino understand the player-billet dynamic well. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been billets ourselves for four years,&rdquo; explains Komnino. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s like your own kid.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='We support each other in any way. Personal lives, hockey lives, we&rsquo;re there for each other'>
The sense of family away from home isn&rsquo;t limited to the billet household, either. Sofillas finds camaraderie with his teammates. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a lot of teammates that support you. We support each other in any way. Personal lives, hockey lives, we&rsquo;re there for each other.&rdquo;
</span></p>

<p>For one weekend late in the season, though, the players get to enjoy some time catching up with family. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all pretty tense,&rdquo; says Sofillas. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a playoff push. It&rsquo;s good to have them come out and watch us, just relax and spend some time to talk and share some stories of how the year&rsquo;s going and what they&rsquo;ve been doing.&rdquo; For the parents like Wendi Sofillas, it&rsquo;s a proud moment to see their sons live. &ldquo;When you come and see them in <em>their</em> rink&ndash;this is <em>their</em> home, right?&ndash;yeah, there is a pride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The players will go back to finding support in their teammates and billet families for the remainder of the season. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough to be without your family, but you really develop a close second family here,&rdquo; says Sofillas. But on Family Day? &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always nice to see your mom and dad.&rdquo;</p>
