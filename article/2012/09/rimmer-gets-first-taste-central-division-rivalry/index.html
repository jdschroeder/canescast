        <div class="byline">September 23, 2012 - by Josh Schroeder</div>
        
        <p>Ty Rimmer knows WHL rivalries. He was, after all, part of the fierce Tri-City/Spokane feud last season. The start of the new season sees him now in Hurricane colours, jumping into a new rivalry, and the well-travelled veteran goalkeeper is game for it.</p>

<p>On Friday night, the visiting Medicine Hat Tigers seemed anxious to welcome Rimmer to the storied Southern Alberta rivalry, striking early on a 2-on-1. Rimmer responded when they came calling again, shutting the door on a breakaway from the blue line. That save established what sort of night it would be for the Hurricane goalie; Rimmer went on to carry the Hurricanes through the first period before they got the offence firing in the second frame on the way to a 4-2 victory.</p>

<p>After the opening goal, only a tipped shot on a penalty kill was able to find its way into the Hurricane goal. 36 other shots were turned aside, although Rimmer downplayed the shot totals after the game. &quot;There&#39;s a big difference between quality shots and quantity,&quot; he said, giving credit to his teammates for clearing rebounds and letting him see shots from the point.</p>

<p>It was a common occurance on Friday night that Rimmer would end up with unfriendly company in his goal crease at the end of a play. Rich Preston had words for the officials on a few occassions when he felt the Tigers had driven the net a little too hard. Rimmer chalked it up to the rivalry, telling us, &quot;you expect that when you play in these rivalry games, guys are going to come to the net hard. I&#39;ve played in a lot of those games where guys are crashing the crease. I don&#39;t mind it.&quot; He certainly handled the heat well, which is good news for the Hurricanes, given the frequency and intensity of central division rivalry match-ups.</p>

<h2>Full house</h2>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='So much fun playing in front of a great crowd like that'>
A good sized crowd took in the opening night victory. A reported attendance of 4514 made for a raucous and lively atmosphere, cheering their team on to victory. The players noticed and appreciated the support. Ty Rimmer called it a &quot;great atmosphere&quot; and said &quot;the fans were unbelievable.&quot; Russ Maxwell <a href="https://twitter.com/Russizzle7/statuses/249388488213012480">echoed those thoughts on Twitter</a>, saying &quot;Thanks to all the @WHLHurricanes fans tonight for the support!! So much fun playing in front of a great crowd like that.&quot;
</span></p>

<h2>Rematch goes the other way</h2>

<p>A night after downing the visiting Tigers during the home opener, the Hurricanes suffered the same fate in Medicine Hat, falling 5-1 in the Tigers&#39; home opener. Sam McKechnie&#39;s second goal of the season late in the third period was the only thing keeping the Hurricanes from being blanked in their first road game of the season. Penalty trouble got the better of the Hurricanes in that occassion, and the Tigers took full advantage, scoring three goals on nine powerplay opportunities. Meanwhile, the Hurricanes struggled to move the puck into scoring areas in front of the Medicine Hat net, resulting in fewer scoring opportunities than the previous night when the they used their speed to get around the Tiger defence well.</p>

<h2>Early test</h2>

<p>The Hurricanes&#39; third game of the season goes Wednesday evening at the Enmax against the Eastern Conference&#39;s consensus favourite Edmonton Oil Kings. The Oil Kings have won 13 consecutive regular season games going back to last season, plus a WHL Championship in last year&#39;s playoffs. After the opening weekend, Edmonton are 2-0 with wins against Kootenay and Red Deer.
