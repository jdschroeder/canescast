        <p>While we have to hope that 50+ shot games are going to be the exception and not the norm it is good to see our goaltender ready and willing to take on the challenge, and prove himself worthy of it.</p>

<h2>Headhunting</h2>

<p>Another season and the head hunters are already out in full force.  With 23 games worth of suspension handed out in the opening weekend (admittedly not all head shots, but enough) and the Hurricanes Ryan Pilon sitting out the game today after a vicious hit to the head in Medicine Hat, we can only hope the focus gets back on the game and not the latest moves from the WWE. I am a fan of hockey, and for me that does not include intent to injure. Sportsmanship and respect are as important as putting a tick in the &#39;W&#39; column, something all hockey players should have instilled in them early.</p>

<h2>Goaltending</h2>

<p>A standing ovation and  chants of &quot;<strong>RIMMER</strong>&quot; followed his stellar play in the second. Rimmer stood on his head putting in what can only be described as a goaltending clinic and was the reason they were still in the game at that point.</p>

<p>In his interview following the game Ty mentioned how special the applause was; sending chills down his spine. Too bad it was a losing cause but Ty has shown early promise and we can hope things will really start to roll as the front 5 take their confidence in him and translate that into team confidence.</p>

<h2>Roughing it Up</h2>

<p>The local boys had to put in some time with the fisticuffs. Edmonton came out with several hard hits in the first, but Yakubowski, Topping, Galbraith and Sofillas put in the extra effort to show that our boys are not push overs.</p>

<h2>The Game</h2>

<p>An unfortunate loss 3-0 for a team that at times seemed overwhelmed and was very much back on it&#39;s heels.    </p>

<p>It was not all bad; highlights in the play of Ty Rimmer (facing 60 shots and saving 57 of them) and, the Wong, Leverton, Duke line lend hope for this year. Our veterans were not absent, but it was hard to spot the effort we are justified in expecting from this crew. There is more in the toolbox then we saw tonight, we just need some people to crack it open.</p>

<p>Glimmers of brilliance exist, and I think we will start to see some hockey that will bring us back; hungry for more of the hockey legend they will show us as the team matures.</p>

<h2>Too Much Respect</h2>

<p>The theme in the post game interviews from Rich Preston and Brady Ramsay was a little too much respect for the Oil Kings. At times it did seem that the team was sitting on it&#39;s heels watching the action. Ramsay was adamant the team&#39;s showing on Saturday will be better and looking him in the eye I want to believe.</p>

<p>This is a team that has the talent to go far. A healthy respect for the opposition is important, but that needs to be balanced by some faith in itself and an understanding of just what they are capable of. The future is hopeful, the present is where we need some work.</p>
