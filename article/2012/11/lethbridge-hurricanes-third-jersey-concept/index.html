        <p>Using our backstage pass and calling in some insider CanesCast favours, we spoke to fellow Caniac and designer of the best looking 3rd Jersey this side of the 49th parallel, Josh Schroeder.</p>

<p><em>CanesCast</em>: Hey Josh – great to see you. Must say love your design for the 3rd Jersey. We have know each other for a few years now, but to a lot of the CanesCast followers, you are just another faceless CanesCaster…. tell us about your association with the Hurricanes?</p>

<p><em>JS</em>: My history with the Hurricanes began in 1999 when I took part in fall rookie camp as an undrafted bantam player. I truly became a Hurricane fan after moving to Lethbridge in 2001 and have since enjoyed two years as a season ticket holder before things took off for CanesCast.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/8166091645/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7254/8166091645_50513324ac.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p><em>CanesCast</em>: have you always been interested in Hockey Jersey design?</p>

<p><em>JS</em>: I have been designing concept hockey jerseys as a hobby since I was a kid and actually helped the U of L Pronghorns women’s hockey team to design a new uniform in 2005. Those were a collaborative effort with the players and coaches, so it didn&#39;t feel as much like my own creation as it does with this Hurricane one.</p>

<p><em>CanesCast</em>: What was your inspiration behind the design?</p>

<p><em>JS</em>: The main design element in my rebranded Hurricanes identity is a Hawker Hurricane aircraft, a fighter employed by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Canadian Air Force during the Second World War. RCAF No. 133 squadron was formed in Lethbridge in 1942, flying the Hurricane XII.</p>

<p><a><img src="http://media.canescast.ca/web/HawkerHurricane.png" alt="Hawker Hurricanes WW2 fighter plane based in Lethbridge, AB"> </a>
HAWKER HURRICANE</p>

<p>Given the rich history that the Canadian Hockey League holds with regard to honoring the Canadian Forces — from the naming of the Memorial Cup itself to commemorative jerseys worn by Memorial Cup hosts — I felt that employing the Hawker Hurricane into my Lethbridge Hurricanes rebrand offered an opportunity to pay tribute to the RCAF.</p>

<p><em>CanesCast</em>: A perfect was of paying respects to our brave heroes for Remembrance Day. Was there anything else behind your unique design?</p>

<p><em>JS</em>: Extending beyond just the Hurricane imagery, I drew on inspiration from the 1948 Olympic gold medalist RCAF Flyers’ uniforms, mimicking their unique striping. I wish that striping would have carried over to the actual jerseys, since I think it completed the look and made the uniform more distinct.</p>

<p>From the Hurricanes’ own history, I sought to include elements from the team’s original red, white, and blue colour scheme, as well as the enduring brand element of a sequence of stars. These colours serve to represent the past success of the Lethbridge Hurricanes as 1997 WHL champions.</p>

<p><em>CanesCast</em>: We love the design you came up with, and the concept is awesome, especially apt that it was unveiled for Military appreciation night. Are there any of the previous ‘special’ Hurricanes’ jerseys you liked?</p>

<p><em>JS</em>: Some of my favourite alternate hockey jerseys are throwback style. The “classic” Hurricane third jerseys from several seasons ago that was re-introduced last season, and the Maple Leaf jerseys from 2010 season are, in my opinion, the best that the Hurricanes have looked, aesthetically. I have attempted to emulate that vintage style with my concept.</p>

<p><em>CanesCast</em>: Tell me about the logo?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/8166090801/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8065/8166090801_c38fb46089.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p><em>JS</em>: The primary graphical element of the logo is a silhouette of a Hawker Hurricane in red. Along with a thick blue circle surrounding the fuselage of the aircraft, the logo subtly implies the roundel that would have adorned the sides of RCAF Hurricanes during WWII. </p>

<p>This tie-in is nicely emphasized by the RCAF roundel on the left side of Ty Rimmer&#39;s mask, actually. Within the blue circle above the aircraft, set in white and arching with the circle is the word Lethbridge, and immediately below the aircraft is the word Hurricanes, set in blue and contouring along the top to complement the shape of the Hurricane’s wings and fuselage. Following the arc of the blue circle beneath the Hurricanes word mark are four white stars representing each of the Hurricanes’ conference championships, and one gold star representing the 1997 WHL championship.</p>

<p>In addition to representing the shape of the RCAF roundel, the circular element abstractly ties the logo to the city of Lethbridge by representing a Chinook arch above the aircraft, and the Old Man River valley beneath. I wanted to add some local relevance in the logo in a subtle manner like that, so I resisted the urge to add a bridge anywhere in the logo.</p>

<p><em>CanesCast</em>: Everyone is just raving about the Jersey, and I know that all of us in the CanesCast office can’t wait to get our hands on one… Caniacs grab them whilst they are hot, limited quantities are available at the Lethbridge Hurricanes souvenir store, open during home games.</p>
