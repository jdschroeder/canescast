        <p>Returning to the Enmax after a two week absence, the Hurricanes take on the Moose Jaw Warriors and the return of Cam Braes. Braes returns with 14 points in 11 games following his trade, while the Canes slipped below five hundred in the same 11 going 5 wins and 6 losses. Emotions should run high as Moose Jaw hunts down first in the East and Lethbridge seeks to shut down Cam on his return.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6844558601/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7001/6844558601_9585cf7a35_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>The first started as a defensive battle with the Canes getting a few great chances. Maxwell shutdown on the doorstep at the 11 minute mark and a drive to the net by  Yakubowski&#39;s that just flipped high over the shoulder of Siemens come to mind. The Warriors got onto the scoreboard at the 5 minute mark, but despite a growing shot disparity the Canes were still in the game. Some penalty trouble by Leverton in the last couple minutes (including one Goaltender Interference call that was dubious at best), and an errant clear out of the ice by Mckecknie led to the Canes facing a 5 on 3 that ended only 10 seconds in on a goal assisted by Cam Braes, the Canes trailing by 2 - 0 heading into the second and down 19 - 5 in shots.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6845110875/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7034/6845110875_e782ed58b2_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>The second period saw a quick breakaway goal by the Warriors, Cam Braes again assisting on the goal. With the score 3 - 0  Warriors the Enmax center was subdued. The Canes were a litle defalated themselves as the Warriors ran roughshod over them for the next few minutes. The momentum shifted a bit when Brody Sutter wristed one high over the glove of Siemens and put the Canes on the board and back within 2 and the Canes seemed to come to life, getting some great chances. Heartbreakingly a Canes 3 on 2 chance was turned on the backcheck by the Warriors and the ensuing attack showed them back up by 3. Captain Sutter was there to again provide some lift putting another one in the same place over the glove of the Warriors goalie; putting the Canes again within 2. The positives outweighed the negatives in the second half of that period and the Canes were setup well for the third, closing the shot gap to 29 - 21.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6845083151/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7156/6845083151_4cdd4f9f52_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>The third period seemed to be ticking away in the third with neither team able to generate any sustained offence and the goaltenders keeping the chances that did occur out with style. With just over two to go in the game Mckechnie potted the games 7th goal putting the Canes within one. The Canes pulled Ketlo with a minute to go and a couple non calls resulted in the Canes missing some chances as they were hauled down. The final blow came on Quinton Howden&#39;s empty net hat trick goal. That sealed the offense and gave Cam Braes, his two assists and his new team the victory.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>It&#39;s hard not to agree with the coach, sound bytes from Preston who suggested the Canes didn&#39;t put in the effort in the first and it costs them the game. The Canes managed to generate few chances in the first and allowed the Warriors to run the game for most of the first half of the game.</p>

<h2><em><a href="http://sportphotographers.ca">SportPhotographers.ca</a></em> Player  of the game: Adam Henry</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6799786967/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7166/6799786967_765fcd5d3e_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>Adam showed great vision, always seemed to put in the effort, and made things happen, contributing three assists tonight! Of his 15 points this season, 6of them have come in the past 5 games.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>A change of pace as the Hurricanes have been struggling at home lately and getting their wins on the road. They&#39;ll look to rebound from tonight&#39;s loss on Friday evening when they host the Saskatoon Blades, 7:00 at the Enmax Centre. Saskatoon have won seven of their last ten and currently occupy 4th place in the Eastern Conference, so they will provide the Hurricanes with another formidable test.</p>

<p>Mark your calendar for February 19th as well, since the Hurricanes will be holding their skills competition at 2:00. Arrive early with a donation for the food bank to get an uncut hockey card poster sheet.</p>
