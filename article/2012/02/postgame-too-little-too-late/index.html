        <p>A Brandon victory over Regina last night officially put the playoffs out of the reach, leaving the Lethbridge Hurricanes looking to play the role of spoiler against the teams jostling for position in the Eastern Conference playoff race. The opponent this afternoon, the Edmonton Oil Kings, currently hold down top spot in the conference, but have been feeling the heat lately from the hard charging Moose Jaw Warriors. In their first game since since being officially eliminated, the Hurricanes have a chance to do their former captain a favour by stealing a couple of points in Edmonton.</p>

<p>No change to the Hurricanes’ line-up for this game, with both Albin Blomqvist and Craig Leverton still sidelined by upper body injuries. Damien Ketlo gets the start in goal.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>Perhaps a side effect of longer than expected road trip on Saturday due to a broken down bus, the Hurricanes came out flat footed in the first period, and the Oil Kings took full advantage, putting the early pressure on the Hurricanes. It took five minutes for the home side to tally their first when Mitch Moroz cut around Adam Henry, through the top of the crease, and tucked the puck inside the far post. Tyler Maxwell extended the lead with a shot through traffic from the right wing wall while Brady Ramsay sat for checking Keegan Lowe from behind. Seconds later, Travis Ewanyk forced a loose puck from behind the net to Moroz who managed to chip it between Ketlo’s pads for his second of the game and a 3-0 Edmonton lead just over ten minutes into the game. The quick deficit prompted Rich Preston to use his time out, and it appeared to have an effect on his players who came out more aggressive and eager to deliver the body. The improved play didn’t pay dividends in the first period, and the teams headed to the intermission with the Oil Kings leading the Hurricanes 3-0 and outshooting them 19-7.</p>

<p>The second period began with a 5-on-3 powerplay after two Oil King penalties late in the first period, but the Hurricanes were unable to capitalize on the powerplay opportunity. Similarly, the Oil Kings had a lengthy 5-on-3 in the second period, but the Hurricanes shut the door with their penalty kill. Defensively the highlight of the period may have been Spencer Galbraith going down awkwardly behind the Hurricane net after getting tied up with an Oil King player. While down in obvious pain, Galbraith thrust himself forward to block a slap shot before the Hurricanes could gain possession and give him an opportunity to get off the ice. That’s a good fighting spirit from a defender whose non-playoff team trails 3-0 in the game. In the final minute of the period the Hurricanes managed to get one past Oil King goalie Laurent Brossoit. Graham Hood drove the net hard keeping the puck moving with his feet so that Brady Ramsay could poke it in to close the score to 3-1 after 40 minutes.</p>

<p>The third period continued on much like the second; The Hurricanes continued pressing, but unable to generate many high quality scoring opportunities. Staphane Legault added a late empty netter to ice the 4-1 victory for the Oil Kings.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>...why the Hurricanes lost. Bus legs, I suppose. The Hurricanes came out flat and got beaten in the first eleven minutes of this game and followed it up with 49 minutes of competitive hockey. From the time the Hurricanes called their time out to the final buzzer, they were the better team in this game, but by that point it was too little too late.</p>

<p>Russ Maxwell earns the nod this afternoon, generating a number of scoring opportunities, even if none of them were converted to goals.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>That winds up the season series between the Hurricanes and Oil Kings. Edmonton had the Hurricanes’ number this season, taking five of the six games between the two teams. The loss ends the Hurricanes’ winning streak at three, preventing them from matching their season high of four.</p>

<p>The Hurricanes continue their road trip Wednesday night in Prince Albert. The Raiders have won 2 of three meetings between the teams this season, although the Hurricanes took the most recent meeting 4-1 back on February 11. That game starts at 6:00 Lethbridge time.
