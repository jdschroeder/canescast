        <p>After a disappointing loss against the Broncos, the Canes travelled into Manitoba to take on the Brandon Wheat Kings. This game gave Goaltender Liam Liston and defenseman Spencer Galbraith the chance to return to their old stomping grounds whilst the Hurricanes got to say hello again to goaltender and Washington Capitals farm player, Brandon Anderson.</p>

<p>Damien Ketlo recovered from the flu to start a game that would bring with it his 4,000 WHL career save. Max Moline returned to the Ice having been out of action since the home opener against the Hitmen.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>Not much between these 2 as they hustled and bustled during the first 20 minutes with a couple of chances at either end, with both goal tenders looking relatively comfortable in their respective goals.
The Canes seemed to have a decent first period and had several opportunities, as it would be a night where the Wheat Kings would spend plenty of time in the penalty box.</p>

<p>With things finely balanced but no goals to show for their efforts, the second period felt like it could be a nervous one for the Canes.</p>

<p>Graham Hood picked the top corner to open the scoring on the power play after Captain Brody Sutter was left with no option but to drop the gloves with Brenden Walker after taking one too many slap to the chops, the Canes were playing like a team ready to win one on the road.</p>

<p>The line of Watson, Merkley and Bezuch were playing well together and in what is a very good indicator of the future of the Canes, they played several good shifts together, resulting in a goal for Bezuch late in the second period to give the Canes a 2-0 lead after 40 minutes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6339321794/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6058/6339321794_02f07054c6_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>Adam Henry, playing in front of family and friends who made the 215km drive from Winnipeg to Brandon to watch him play, ensured they hadn&#39;t made the journey in vain as he notched the Hurricanes third of the night with 5 minutes gone in the third.</p>

<p>Damien Ketlo was superb in goal for Lethbridge and seemed to get to everything in his quest to keep a clean sheet and surpass his 4,000 WHL career save.</p>

<p>At this point, only a Hurricanes win looked to be on the cards, however, Brandon started to rally and within a minute Stone took Ketlo’s chance of a shutout away, by what can only be described as a strange goal to concede, banking the puck in off the back of his neck.</p>

<p>There was still lots of hockey in this game and just as Caniacs across the province thought, this might be the turning point, Max Moline in only his second WHL game of his career, scored his first WHL goal getting a tip to a Daniel Johnston bomb from the blue line.</p>

<p>The Wheaties pulled within 2 goals, scoring on the powerplay with just under 8 minutes left, but even pulling eheir goal tender with 3 miuntes to go and putting their best 6 players out. Brandon couldn’t stop this hard working and resilient Canes team from leaving Brandon with the win 4-2, having been outshot 43-34 in regulation. </p>

<h2>One good reason ...  they won</h2>

<p>Discipline – they kept out of the box and kept their formation, playing to their strengths and soaking up the pressure from a talented and skilled Wheat Kings side.</p>

Damien kept the Hurricanes in the game, saving shot after shot, standing on his head, bending over backward, making 41 saves, passing his 4k mark and showing just how good a fit and healthy Ketz can play.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>Road games are always tough for the Canes they stuck to the task tonight to double up Brandon 4-2 whilst nothing up their 9th road win of the season
Each period was played to perfection and as Brandon struggled with penalties the Canes kept their heads and stayed out of the box.</p>

<h2>Next Up</h2>

<p>Canes finish their road trip Saturday night as they head west to Regina to take on the Pats, puck drops at 6:00pm.</p>
