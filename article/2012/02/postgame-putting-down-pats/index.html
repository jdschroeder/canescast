        <h1>Postgame: Putting down the Pats</h1>
        <div class="byline">February 17, 2012 - by Morgan Martin</div>
        
        <p>Tonights game faces Damien Ketlo holding off 45 saves in his previous sting against his former teammates as he gave the Canes the win on that night. The Pats lead the season series by one with the Canes in the hunt to even that up. The Canes should enter tonights game with confidence and after a strong performance in a loss that came down to the opposing teams Goaltender shutting them down on too many chances to count. That marked the second gutsy effort in a row and signs that the lack of effort that had marked a string of games may be coming to an end.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>The first period showed a continuation of the shot blocking we saw in the last game. Many of those were blocks at the line that a little luck could have turned into breakaways or two on ones. The Canes had the run in the early going as they seemed to control possession and found themselves in the Pat&#39;s zone more often then not. Roughly half way through the first the Pat&#39;s were able to get one past Ketlo as Stevenson got a little room and was able to slap it from 30 feet away up and over the Cane&#39;s keeper&#39;s shoulder. Play seemed to favour the Pat&#39;s for a bit after that but the Canes Tot was able to find a thin seem lifting the puck just off the ice and just past Hewitt as Ramsay had generated a chance, confusion and a rebound that managed to find it&#39;s way to Tot&#39;s stick. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6894690147/" title="Phil Tot celebrates a first period goal by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7209/6894690147_9c2fd7aa66_z.jpg" alt="Phil Tot celebrates a first period goal"></a></p>

<p>The score heading into the second was tied at 1. The period was to prove to be a fire cracker. The period started poorly for the Canes as they were trapped in early. An unlucky helmet loss by Kizuik and the subsequnet penalty resulted in the Pat&#39;s retaking the lead  2 - 1. That blip was followed by a crushing, from behind hit on Leverton taht sent him hobbling off the ice. The same play send Fenske out for 5 and a game. Ramsay made them pay quickly tieing the game at 2. What followed was a series of hits and some intensly physical play. Unable to capatalize on the rest of the major the Canes found themseleves down again as Marantz beat Ketlo on the behind the net play off of the skate. Down 3 - 2 the Canes went into overdrive. Leverton&#39;s returned and made it know with a crushing hit that gave the Canes another power play inspite of multiple penalties. Sutter undressed Hewitt, crossing the crease and lifting it over. Weal took a slashing penalty and that set up Yakubowski to put another one in the Pat&#39;s net. Before the goal could be announced, Buonassisi and Stevenson dropped the gloves and threw down old school, neither flinching at the repeated hits. At the end of the second there were a lot of bad feelings and a Lethbridge Hurricanes team up 5 - 2.</p>

<p>The third period saw the Canes slow the game down. The fireworks from the second carried through some, but the focus seemed to be back on the playmaking aspects of the game. The Pats made it a game as Marincin potted one unassisted on Ketlo. The Canes get their game simple, play was mostly in the Pats end and the neutral zone as the defense came to bear. Into the final minutes the Pats goalie on the bench. The final minute Galbraith is sent off for boarding and we have some tension. With 50 seconds to go Kizuik lifted the puck up and down the ice. That puck had eyes as it rolled in a wide arc straight in for the 6th canes goal. The Canes left their goalminder off of the ice as time wound down, but the game finished 6 - 4 as the Hurricanes put down the Pats.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>Physical play was huge in this game. The canes, motivated perhaps by Leverton being hit hard, took the game to a physical level we haven&#39;t seen in a while.</p>
