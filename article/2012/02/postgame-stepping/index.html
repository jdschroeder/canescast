        <p>The road trip continues tonight in Prince Albert against the basement dwelling Raiders, and the Hurricanes look to rebound from Sunday afternoon’s loss in Edmonton. Brady Ramsay is the latest addition to the injured list after a hit in the third period of Sunday’s game. Initial prognosis was that Ramsay could miss the remainder of the season, but he is now being listed as out for a week with an upper body injury. Brody Sutter also sits tonight, day-to-day with a back injury.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the Hurricanes, some prospects have now become available after their teams were eliminated from the post-season. Tyler Wong and Harrison Harper make the trip and join Max Moline to form the fourth line.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>Not wanting a repeat of what happened in Edmonton on Sunday, the Hurricanes got right down to business tonight. After Prince Albert iced the puck seconds into the game, the Hurricanes won the draw back to Landon Oslanski who rimmed the puck around the boards and behind the net where Sam McKechnie collected it. McKechnie moved the puck out front to Graham Hood who tucked it away for a 1-0 lead only 23 seconds into the game. Hood struck again ten minutes into the period after Nick Buonassisi was run over by a solid hit from Austin Bourhis. As the two had words, Hood carried the puck across the top of the crease and slid it past Cole Holowenko to put the Hurricanes up 2-0. It was a dominant period for the Hurricanes, outshooting the Raiders 20-2 through 20 minutes.</p>

<p>The second period got off to a similarly quick start, but this time it was the Raiders who got on the board. Anthony Bardaro around a screen in front of the net and went top corner on Liston’s glove side. Only ten seconds later Russ Maxwell collected a puck in the corner of the Raiders’ zone and fed it out front to Juraj Bezuch who burried it to quickly restore the Hurricanes’ two goal lead. Bardaro tallied his second of the evening in similar fashion to his first, taking a pass from Justin Maylan on a 2-on-1 and then going upstairs on Liston’s glove side. Each team would have some powerplay opportunities during the period, but neither side could capitalize on their chances with the man advantage and 3-2 is how it stood after 40 minutes.</p>

<p>The Raiders controlled most of the play in the third period, sending 17 shots Liam Liston’s way. For the better part of the period it was the <em>Liam Liston Show</em>, keeping the Raiders at bay and maintaining the one goal lead. With under two minutes to play, though, the Hurricanes got caught running around in their own zone, allowing Josh Morissey to find Justin Maylan at the side of the net for a chip-in goal. Prince Albert continued their late surge, forcing a pad save from Liston to save the game and send it to overtime.</p>

<p>Nothing was solved in overtime, so a shootout would be required to decide it. Liam Liston shut the door on Mark McNeill&#39;s five hole attempt on the first shot before Juraj Bezuch replied with his standard big deke, pulling Cole Holowenko out of position and sliding the puck into the wide open net. Anthony Bardaro then put a good deke on Liston, but lost a handle on the puck and couldn’t put it away before it rolled wide. Phil Tot sealed the victory on the next shot, freezing Holowenko with a fake before shooting inside the post stick side.</p>

<p>The 4-3 win improves the Hurricanes’ league best overtime and shootout record to 5-0-0-1 on the season.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>...why the Hurricanes won. The opposite of Sunday, they came out strong and dominated early and managed to hang on thanks largely to a strong goaltending performance in the third period.</p>

<p>Juraj Bezuch gets the honour tonight, scoring a goal in the second period and adding one in the shootout. He showed good chemistry for much of the night with Russ Maxwell, cycling in the Raiders’ zone and setting up scoring opportunities that could have put the game away earlier.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>Playing without their top two scorers, the Hurricanes needed somebody to step up tonight to fill the offensive void. Various players did at times, and strong games from Graham Hood and Juraj Bezuch got the job done.</p>

<p>Back on track after Sunday’s setback, the Hurricanes continue on down the road to Brandon where they will take on the Wheat Kings on Friday night. The Wheat Kings have been playing well lately, going 8-1-0-1 in their past ten as they try to gain ground on seventh place Regina while fending off the ninth place Rebels.</p>

<p>Game time is 6:30 local time. Be sure to follow along on @CanesCast and the  <em><a href="http://sportphotographers.ca">SportPhotographers.ca</a></em> Game Portal.</p>
