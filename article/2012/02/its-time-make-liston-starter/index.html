        <p>The question of who resides at the top of the goaltending depth chart for the Lethbridge Hurricanes was a source of much speculation early this season. After the overage cutdown deadline, the goaltending rotation was stabilized with the veteran Damien Ketlo getting the majority of the starts when healthy. While there was a glimmer of hope for a miraculous run at the playoffs has vanished, it is time for Rich Preston to reconsider his team’s goaltending strategy.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the statistical peformance of the Hurricane goaltenders this season:</p>

<td>1160</td>
<td>1045</td>
<td>0.901</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Neither goaltender has put up exceptional numbers this season, although both have put in a couple of very good individual performances. Comparatively, though, this is what we would expect to see out of a starter and back-up, with Ketlo earning a better win-loss record, a lower goals against average, and higher save percentage. It’s a simplified view of their performances, but it does suggest that Ketlo gives the Hurricanes a better chance to win games.</p>

<p>The thing is, wins next season have now become more important than wins this season. This isn’t a suggestion that the team should be taking the remainder of this season less seriously, it is in their best interest to consider what moves are in their best interest for next season.</p>

<p>Among the things that the coaching staff must address is what their goaltending situation will be next season. Coming into camp this season there was little doubt that Brandon Anderson and Tanner Kovacs would make the opening day roster. There was little competition to push them, and it would seem that Kovacs wasn’t ready to make the step to the WHL. Next season we should see some competition for the back-up role, while Liam Liston is in line to take over as starter. If he is expected to take on that role next year, it makes sense to give him the starts now in order to give him more experience, and hopefully build his confidence.</p>

<p>So with 16 games remaining, I hope we see Liston making 10 to 12 starts. Of course, it is entirely possible that Rich Preston has a trick up his sleeve, like maybe taking advantage of having two first round picks and including one in a trade for a starting goaltender. Either way, it’s worth making moves now with the goal of improving the team next season.</p>
