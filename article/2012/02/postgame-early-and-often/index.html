        <div class="byline">February 11, 2012 - by Josh Schroeder</div>
        
        <p>After a couple of disappointing losses on home ice, the Hurricanes looked to get back on the winning track against the conference’s worst team tonight. The Prince Albert Raiders may occupy the eastern conference basement, but thay have had the Hurricanes’ number this season, winning 5-2 in Prince Albert back in November and 6-3 here in Lethbridge just a couple of weeks ago. With only four points between the two teams, the ‘Canes would like to gain a little more ground to avoid the dubious distincation of finishing 12th.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>The Hurricanes opened the scoring early when Adam Henry dumped a puck high into the zone. Josh Morrissey of the Raiders tried to glove the puck down, but lost track of it in the process, allowing Sam McKechnie to collect it and get around him, snapping the puck past Cole Holowenko’s blocker and inside the far post. McKechnie added his second of the game before five minutes had elapsed, finishing off a fast rush and shovelling in a Nick Buonassisi rebound to make it 2-0. Prince Albert used their time out immediately after allowing the goal, looking to regroup before the game completely passed them by. Initially it seemed to work as they hemmed the Hurricanes into their own zone for an extended period, but the pressure was limited to one shift. Just beyond the halfway point of the period, Jamal Watson saucered a pass from the left wing into Jay Merkley who was driving the net. Merkley lost his footing, but managed to put the puck past Holowenko while sliding on his knees. The 3-0 goal spelled the end of Holowenko’s evening, allowing three goals on eight shots in eleven minutes; Luke Lee-Knight took over duties between the pipes. McKechnie nearly completed the hat trick a short while later on another centering pass from Buonassisi, but put the puck just over the net.</p>

<p>The Raiders got the opportunity to turn the tides early in the second period after Graham Hood earned an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after the first period buzzer had sounded. Building on a strong first period, Liam Liston shut the door to kill the penalty and keep the Raiders from getting any momentum back. Prince Albert captain Mark McNeill took a hooking penalty in his own zone, sending the Hurricanes to the powerplay when Russ Maxwell capitalized, deceptively stepping out of the corner when he looked to be getting ready to pass and then tucking a backhander under the crossbar to give the Hurricanes a 4-0 lead. Prince Albert managed to get on the board late in the period when Logan McVeigh found his way behind the Hurricanes’ defence and, under pressure from Dan Johnston, dropped a pass to Anthony Bardaro who went upstairs to beat a laterally moving Liston.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6860163839/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7181/6860163839_6bc11fb4fc_z.jpg" alt="The Hurricanes celebrate Merkley&#39;s goal"></a></p>

<p>The Hurricanes used plenty of powerplay time in the third period to keep the Raiders on their heels. Lee-Knight was equal to the task, though, turning aside all 14 shots he faced in the final frame and 32 of 33 overall. The Hurricanes were strong defensively as well, keeping Prince Albert to only six shots, keeping them from having any chance of getting back into the game. When the dust settled, the Hurricanes had earned the 4-1 win.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>...why the Hurricanes won: Puck pressure. The Hurricanes won the races to loose pucks in all areas of the ice, and forced turnovers in the Raiders’ zone. They were the more puck hungry team and were able to generate scoring chances from their possession.</p>

<h2><em><a href="http://sportphotographers.ca">SportPhotographers.ca</a></em> Player of the Game</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6799803015/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7018/6799803015_8681f74d7e_z.jpg" alt="Player of the game Sam McKechnie"></a></p>

<p>Sam McKechnie’s two goals early in the first period may have been enough to wrap this one up for him, but he and his line with Nick Buonassisi and Graham Hood just continued generating chances all game long. McKechnie really could have had five goals in this one.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>Back in the win column, the Hurricanes are now only one win short of last season’s total, and only a point back of the Swift Current Broncos for 10th spot in the conference. While the post-season is all but out of reach, a late season push to pass another team or two wouldn’t hurt the young group’s confidence.</p>

<p>Next up is a match-up with the Brandon Wheat Kings, 7:00 on Wednesday night at the Enmax Centre. The Wheat Kings are fighting for their playoff lives, holding down 8th spot in the east and currently riding a three game win streak.</p>

<p>Also coming up, the Hurricanes will be hosting a cancer awareness night next Friday when they host the Regina Pats at 7:00, and then the skills competition on Sunday the 19th at 2:00.</p>
