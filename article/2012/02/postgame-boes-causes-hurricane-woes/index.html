        <p>The Hurricanes went into battle against the Brandon Wheat Kings riding a solid effort and hard earned win against the Prince Albert Raiders. The Canes looked to keep the momentum going and show some heart as they head into the seasons final games.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6884337831/" title="Phil Tot winces on the way to the bench after blocking a shot by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7196/6884337831_91557db8c6_z.jpg" alt="Phil Tot winces on the way to the bench after blocking a shot"></a></p>

<p>The Canes were strong defensively in the first and kept pace with the Kings in shots. The first period saw Tot getting himself in front of the puck with some gutsy shot blocks and making some strong plays. The Canes were regularily there to clear the front of the net and put some pressure on the other end with a couple chances. The only real blip in the period was what looked to be a misplay by Liston who wasn&#39;t able to control the puck on the diving cover and the Kings squeeze the puck past the pads. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6884497509/" title="Adam Henry battles Michael Ferland in front of Liam Liston by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7049/6884497509_f302fcb1e7_z.jpg" alt="Adam Henry battles Michael Ferland in front of Liam Liston"></a></p>

<p>The second period seemed to be going the way some previous games have gone in teh past few. The Canes quickly found themselves down by 2 more goals with the score sitting 3 - 0 at the 11 minute mark of the game, the first one coming at 21 seconds. Things changed after that. Tot, on a great outlet pass from Brady Ramsay, rang one off the post that Brody Sutter was able to blast into the empty net. Some crash the net play by Hood and Leverton resulted in them Hood driving one past Boes who couldn&#39;t get tight to the net. Tot was there for the blocks and some desperation play under pressure by the Canes helped them to keep the 3 - 2 score going. They played hard in that period but the theme for the night was going to be Boes&#39; strong play in net.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6884318507/" title="Max Moline by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7043/6884318507_537b0f0d36_z.jpg" alt="Max Moline"></a></p>

<p>The third period was very good for the Canes. They went down 4 - 2 at the 2 minute mark, but shut the Kings down from that point and brought the play into the opposing end. The Canes piled chance after chance on the Kings goaltender. Hood and Leverton and Brody and Tot seemed to be everywhere in this one, generating countless chances. The Canes got their first power play opportunity in the dying minutes but couldn&#39;t make it work for them. With 2 minutes to go they sat Liston on the bench and applied some great pressure for the first minute. An errant pass from across the blue line saw them taking a face off back in their end that they never could get control of with time winding down and the score going to Brandon 4 - 2; inspite of the great chances and the Canes being up in shots 41 - 32.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>The Canes could not solve the complex equation that was Boes. He let a couple in on some stellar plays by our home town boys, but the Wheat Kings were able to ride a hot goaltender and get some past Liston to take the lead in the season series.</p>

<h2><em><a href="http://sportphotographers.ca">SportPhotographers.ca</a></em> Player of the Game</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6884600747/" title="Phil Tot fighting Eric Roy at the end of the game by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7062/6884600747_0aa54614b0_z.jpg" alt="Phil Tot fighting Eric Roy at the end of the game"></a></p>

<p>The Player of the Game honours went to Philip Tot on this night. Philip was a warrior, hobbling off the ice on a great shot block in the first and returning to keep up the shot blocking, add an assist on what could easily have been a goal, create tons of chances and elevate the play of his line and his team inspite of being down. Hat&#39;s off to a warrior in a great game.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>The Canes host the Prince Albert Raiders on Friday in which I know the Caniacs will be supporting another Saturday Night performance.</p>
