<p>Ryan Pilon and Johnny Hogue got the call up for this game as Damien Ketlo was suffering Flu and defensemen, Spencer Galbraith and Albin Blomqvist both out of the team injured.</p>

<p>Big night for the Canes as they sat just 4 points back from Swift Current before this game.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>Canes wanted a win badly and it showed, as they were the brighter team from the puck drop.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, their early hustle went with out reward as against the run of play, Liam Liston was beaten through the five hole, when the Canes were in the ascendancy.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6529247117/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7151/6529247117_1699a6379f_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>Canes brought it level and then went ahead, Phil Tot scoring on the power play with Jaimen Yakubowski scoring less than 50 seconds later to give the canes the lead, 2-1.</p>

<p>Hurricanes had lots of possession during the first period of play, but with a couple of lapses in concentration late on, the Broncos took the lead back as they too scored 2 in quick succession at the end of the first to go in 3-2 after 20 minutes.</p>

<p>The second was a period for the goal tenders as both Liston and Groenheyde made excellent saves, of note Liston going post to post to deny Swift Current when they looked certain to extend their lead.</p>

<p>The Canes defense was a lot tighter in the second and covered for their goal tender well with Liston seeing just 8 shots having faced 18 in the first.</p>

<p>With nothing to split these sides, the Hurricanes caught up on the shot clock with both teams registering 26 shots after 40 minutes of play.</p>

<p>Landon Oslanski tied things on the power play into the third after good work from Graham Hood and Dan Johnston opened up the Broncos.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6255659749/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6162/6255659749_bce261769d_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>This was not to last, as the Broncos retook the lead on the power play. In a back and forth encounter, no sooner did Swift Current go ahead, Juraj Bezuch scored a beauty after a wonderful cross ice pass was fired in from Jamal Watson.</p>

<p>However, this wasn&#39;t to be Lethbridge&#39;s night as a tough piece of luck gave the broncos the lead after 
Nedomiel&#39;s shot took a wicked deflection and spun over Liston&#39;s head dipping into the back of the Canes net. 
Vause made it 6-4 minutes later and with that took the contest away from Lethbridge.</p>

<p>The first of 3 road games ended in a loss for the Hurricanes, as they were left too much to do to get themselves back into this one after having several chances to win this one.</p>

<h2>One good reason ...</h2>

<p>In what was a relatively evenly matched game, a tough deflection got the better of the Canes and with the Broncos scoring 2 goals in 2 minutes in the final 10 minutes, the Hurricanes had too much to do in order to get themselves back into this one. Even puling Liam Liston for the last 3 minutes and having a late power play, couldn&#39;t help the Canes force overtime.</p>

<h2><em><a href="http://lethbridgewebdesign.ca">Lethbridge Web Design</a></em> Hardest Working Hurricane: Jamal Watson</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6777568345/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7021/6777568345_0f067078fe_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>Jamal continues to improve in his first WHL season, getting better with every game. 
Tonight&#39;s game showed just how far he has come, great back checking and awesome offence and vision with a perfect cross-ice pass to set up Juraj Bezuch&#39;s goal.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>Playing away from home has been tough for the Canes this year registering just 8 wins away from the Enmax.</p>

<p>In a game that could have gone either way, the Canes had every chance to win this one, until a bad deflection allowed a freak goal and then a sucker punch minutes later served up a tough loss on the road.</p>

<h2>Next Up</h2>

<p>Lethbridge&#39;s travels continue onto Brandon, Manitoba on Friday and Regina on Saturday, before their return to the Enmax nexy Wednesday heralds the return of ex-captain and Enmax favourite, Cam Braes as the Moose Jaw Warriors come to town.</p>

<p>Puck drops at 6:30pm on Friday, with your continued coverage home and away, here @CanesCast.</p>
