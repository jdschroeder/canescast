        <p>With a fantastic win last night against the Brandon What Kings, the Hurricanes made their last stop on the road as the took on the Regina Pats. Looking to build on a disciplined performance, and to gain a back to back road wins, something that has been incredibly elusive this season.</p>

        Damien Ketlo got the start once more after posting 41 saves last night and playing for the final time of his WHL career in the stadium he spent 3 years calling home.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6201858507/" title="Phil Tot drives to the Regina net by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6020/6201858507_16f2f90835_z.jpg" alt="Phil Tot drives to the Regina net"></a></p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>Regina were all over the Canes from the start, and if it wasn’t for a master class from Damien Ketlo, Lethbridge could have easily been down by a couple of goals early on.</p>

<p>The Pats made all the running as the Canes defended strongly with Ketlo continuing to be the difference between these teams.
When the Hurricanes got their first shot of the game, it resulted in a goal.
Great work from Nick Buonassisi as he fed Sam McKechnie in the slot with a perfect cross ice pass, Sam slotting it past Beukeboom. 1 shot 1 goal.</p>

<p>Pats continued to press hard, but Ketlo appeared unbeatable as he flew from post to post to deny the Pats time after time.</p>

<p>The Canes continued where they left off in the first as they continued to soak up the pressure from Regina as Damien Ketlo seemed determined to show the Pats’ fans what they are missing since his trade to Lethbridge.</p>

<p>After Henry passed the puck towards the Regina bench having seen them with too man men on the ice during a line change, the Canes doubled their lead as Brady Ramsay placed it inch perfect, top corner on the power play, great play from the Canes.
After 40 minutes the shots were 25-10 in favour of the Pats and if it weren’t for Damien Ketlo, the score would have been heavily weighted in Regina’s favour.</p>

<p>With each period a mirror image of the preceding one, Pats fired shot after shot on Ketlo, Canes catch a break on a rare shot…. The third was no different….</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6271399804/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6056/6271399804_f1cb8b61f0_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>Ketlo continued to produce in goal and the Canes could find nothing until, rushing the net, and with the Hurricanes first shot of the period, Nick Buonassisi slotted it past the blocker of Buekeboom and the Canes now had a 3 goal lead.</p>

<p>The Pats did eventually beat Ketlo as they put one past him with 9:30 left in the game. 
As the onslaught continued the Canes could just about hang on.
Regina pulled their goalie with three minutes to go, and when they beat Ketlo for a second time with a minute left, Caniacs feared the worst.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t to be though, as Ketlo stayed strong and the Hurricane team did all they could to clear the puck and clean up at the back, allowing them to hang on to win their second on the road in as many days, 3-2.</p>

<h2>One good reason ... why they won</h2>

<p>Damien Ketlo – he really was the difference between the Canes getting rail-roaded in Regina and them pulling off their first back to back road wins of the season.</p>

<h2><em><a href="http://lethbridgewebdesign.ca">Lethbridge Web Design</a></em> Player Of The Game: Damien Ketlo</h2>

<p>Last night he was amazing, tonight he was world class making 45 saves. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6598494585/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7031/6598494585_8bd03f0ae7_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>Without him being on form in his old arena, the Canes would be travelling back licking their wounds, instead they get to ride the happy bus back to Lethbridge – arise Sir Ketlo!</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>For the first time this season the Canes have registered back to back wins on the road, and they have been due in large part to the outstanding goal tending of Damien Ketlo.</p>

<p>After these performances, you can only assume that he will get the nod when the Hurricanes host Cam Braes and the Moose Jaw Warriors back at the Enmax.</p>

<p>The whole team should be congratulated as they have really stuck to the task, working hard every shift to win these games whilst playing great road hockey!</p>

<h2>Next Up</h2>

<p>Canes return to the Enmax to welcome back the Moose Jaw Warriors and ex-captain Cam Braes, Wednesday, February 8th. Puck drops @ 7:00pm (403) 329 SEAT for tickets.</p>
