        <p>After a strong and disciplined performance to beat the Moose Jaw Warriors in their last game at the Enmax, the Hurricanes showed that they are not lying down and dreaming of the golf course just yet.</p>

<p>The Hitmen make the short journey down the highway for the final time this season; the teams have split the four games played so far, with each team winning both of their home games to hold the series at 2-2.</p>

<p>Reid Duke sheds the full cage tonight, now sporting a visor and looking like a regular WHLer.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>The Hurricanes got the jump in the first period, at one point leading 9-1 on the shot clock, but even with a couple of powerplay opportunities were unable to capitalize in the early going. The cause of one of those powerplays was a solid hit by Macoy Erkamps at the Hurricane blue line that caused Cody Sylvester to drop the gloves with him. Erkamps delivered a couple of quick rights and Sylvester ended up earning the instigating penalty. Trevor Cheek opened the scoring for the Hitmen at the midway point of the period, sneaking one past Ketlo from close-in. Victor Rask doubled the lead minutes later after knocking Erkamps down along the wall, circling to the high slot and beating Ketlo high on the glove side. Immediately after the ensuing face-off Spencer Galbraith dropped the gloves with Brock Sutherland. The Calgary defenceman had the measure of Galbraith, tying him up and landing the bulk of the punches. The Hurricanes found their way onto the scoreboard with less than three minutes remaining in the period when Jaimen Yakubowski took a pass at the Hitmen blue line, carried to the top of the circle and blasted a snap shot top corner to close the score to 2-1. After 20 minutes the Hurricanes held the edge in shots 16-8.</p>

<p>The Hitmen got the eary jump in the second period, forcing a couple of early saves from Ketlo. Several minutes of uninterrupted play followed, bringing lots of movement, but not a whole lot of scoring opportunities. The Hurricanes’ best chance of the period to that point was a nice give and go play between Hood and Buonassisi, but Driedger was able to make the stop on the play. The Hitmen hurried back the other way on a 2-on-1 where Brady Brassart took a pass and redirected it past Ketlo for a 3-1 lead. Sam McKechnie earned the goal back, fighting off Sutherland to reach a pass from Hood in the low slot where he chipped it inside the far post to make it 3-2. Late in the period Galbraith mishandled the puck at the Calgary blue line resulting in a breakaway for Alex Gogolev. Landon Oslanski hurried back and got his stick in to interrupt the chance and make the shot a little less threatening for Ketlo who made the save. After 40 minutes of play, the Hurricanes trailed 3-2, while the Hitmen fought back to take a 27-26 lead in the shot tally.</p>

<p>The Hurricanes drew even early in the third as Reid Duke showed impeccable vision, making space at the side of the net and then feeding Max Moline on the far post for the tying goal. The Hitmen restored the lead with eight and a half minutes to play when Collin Bowman took advantage of a screen on the rush and beat Ketlo inside the post on the glove side. A minute later the Hitmen would get back to a two goal advantage when Ketlo lost control of a bouncing dump-in and had it trickle behind him, just inside the post. One last open netter and the game ended with the Canes down 6-3.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>A brief defensive lapse and unlucky bounce allowed the Hitmen to score a couple goals and secure the win.</p>

<h2><em><a href="http://sportphotographers.ca">SportPhotographers.ca</a></em> Player of the Game</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6293093531/" title="Sam McKechnie by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6047/6293093531_8d4f98e709_z.jpg" alt="Sam McKechnie"></a></p>

<p>Tonight&#39;s Player of the Game went to Sam McKechnie. McKechnie was a warrior in every shift and battled until the bitter end. Great effort on our player of the games part.</p>

<h2>Wrap up</h2>

<p>The Hitmen managed to pick away at the Hurricanes after a good start by the home side tonight. The Hurricanes now get one more outting in front of the home crowd before closing out the season on the road next week.</p>

<p>Next up: the Hurricanes take on the Medicine Hat Tigers for the final home game of the season. The annual player awards ceremony will take place prior to the game, so be in your seat early. (403)329-SEAT for tickets. Puck drops at 7:00pm.</p>
