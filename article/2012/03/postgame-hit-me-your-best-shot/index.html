        <p>With the Canes finishing their home fixtures for the season with a couple of losses, including one to the Hitmen, they traveled to Calgary looking for revenge and close out their season series against the Hitmen on an even keel after trailing 3-2 before tonight&#39;s game.</p>

<p>Playing for their places on the roster next season and with Captain Brody Sutter looking to get to the 30 goal mark for the season before he starts his career in the NHL, the Canes had everything to play for. Prior to the game Coach Rich Preston had been telling them that they have to go into every game with the commitment, effort and hard work to win it and not be thinking about the golf course with 3 games left in the season.</p>

<p>And that is exactly what they did......</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>The Canes got off to a flying start as Jaimen Yakubowski, fired one in from the boards to give the canes the early lead, Juraj Bezuch with the assist.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6822549342/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7207/6822549342_acb846c249_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>Soon after Russell Maxwell made it 2-0 on the power play and the Canes were flying having scored twice on just 3 shots. Defensive stalwart Dan Johnston with the assist in front of his home town crowd, and Jaimen Yakubowski who was having an excellent night.</p>

<p>Damien Ketlo, again solid in goal for the Hurricanes was beaten by Victor Rask after making the initial  kick save, tough luck after good work from the hurricane goal tender.</p>

<p>Graham Hood who was playing in his 250th whl game, was on target to restore the Canes 2 goal lead as he buried a quick shot past Dreidger after good work from Adam Henry and Juraj Bezuch with his second assist of the night.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6822549510/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7069/6822549510_676a3f1015_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>With a 30% success rate the Canes went in having scored 3 times on just 10 shots as the Hitmen really hustled to try and get back into the game.</p>

<p>It was truly a great first period from the canes, but caution was needed after they lead by 3 earlier in the season playing in the Saddledome allowing the Hitmen back in to win.</p>

<p>The second started with a power play for the Canes, but just 9 seconds after it expired, the Hitmen pulled one back via Trevor Cheek to make it a one goal game,3-2.</p>

<p>Jamal Watson dropped the gloves with Calder Brooks and even though Watson  took a couple of shots early on, he landed a big shot to end the fight to great applause from the partisan crowd.</p>

<p>A great night for the rookies as Sam McKechnie, from behind the Calgary net, banked one in off Hitmen goaltender, Chris Dreidger, restoring the Hurricanes’ 2 goal cushion with assists from Landon Oslanski and Captain Brody Sutter.</p>

<p>McKechnie’s goal heralded the end of the night for Dreidger with Brandon Glover replacing him in the Calgary net with Lethbridge leading 4-2.</p>

<p>Things started to get chippy with both Russ Maxwell and Cody Sylvester taking 2 each for roughing as the game threatened to become more physical, but as the Hitmen stepped p the pace, the Hurricanes stayed disciplined to not get into more trouble than they need to.</p>

<p>Canes defended well even killing a 4 on 3 penalty after Tot was called for hooking, but they stood firm as Damien Ketlo kept them in it time after time.</p>

<p>The Canes withstood a lot of pressure from the Hitmen, often struggling to clear the puck past the blue line, but with a lot of grit and determination, they kept the score at 4-2 after 40 minutes having been out shot 26-19 at the break.</p>

<p>With Spencer Galbraith being called for a high stick late on in the second, the Canes started the 3rd on the penalty kill. Great defensive play combined with strong goal-tending kept them with a 2 goal lead.</p>

<p>Jamal Watson chasing the Gordie Howe hatrick scored with 4:15 gone in the final frame pretty much secured the win for the Hurricanes. The goal went for review as Glover took the puck into his own net, but the officials ruled it a goal and the Canes had a 3 goal lead with a little over 15 minutes left in the game.
More hard work and craft from Calgary pressurized the Hurricanes, but they couldn’t be undone as a great defensive performance saw them run this one out, winning 5-2 having been out shot 39-30 in regulation.</p>

<h2>Wrap up</h2>

<p>Ruthless in front of goal the Hurricanes scored 5 times on 30 shots and backed it up with great defense to restrict the Hitmen to 2 goals on 39 shots. A true team effort that restored some pride to this battling Lethbridge side.</p>

<h2><em><a href="http://sportphotographers.ca">SportPhotographers.ca</a></em> Player of the Game: Jaimen Yakubowski</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6968672243/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7203/6968672243_2f29f8bf2c_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>Simply superb tonight pitching in with a goal and an assist, always hustling creating and having several more chances on a line that will cause many problems next season.</p>

<h2>One good reason.....</h2>

<p>Team work: This Lethbridge Hurricanes team won’t lie down for anyone, and tonight they showed their team spirit and hustle as they made the most of their opportunities in front of goal, fighting for each other and covering defensively to ensure the bus back to Lethbridge was a happy one.</p>

<h2>Next up:</h2>

<p>Canes travel to Red Deer to take on the Rebels for their second to last game of the season. All your play by play here @canescast. Puck drops at 7:30pm.</p>
