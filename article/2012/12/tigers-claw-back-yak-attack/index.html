        <h1>Tigers claw back from Yak Attack</h1>
        <div class="byline">December 08, 2012 - by Josh Schroeder</div>
        
        <p>The night should have been about Jaimen Yakubowski. The recently honoured WHL player of the week is putting in a strong case for consecutive wins, but despite Yakubowski&rsquo;s five goal effort, the Hurricanes could not hang on for a victory over their rivals from Medicine Hat.</p>

<p>A night after soundly beating the Edmonton Oil Kings 6-2, things seemed to all be going right for the Hurricanes against the Tigers. Russ Maxwell got things started with a powerplay goal less than seven minutes into the game, followed up by a pair of Yakubowski tallies to give the &lsquo;Canes a 3-0 lead after 20 minutes.</p>

<p>The second period is where things started to get messy, though. The teams traded goals in the opening half of the period before the Tigers took advantage of a Tyler Wong double-minor penalty scoring once on the powerplay and again just after the penalty had expired. The momentum was suddenly completely favouring the Tigers. That is, until Yakubowski got back to work, striking twice more in the final five minutes of the period, including a buzzer beater with 0.3 seconds remaining. Once again it seemed like the Hurricanes had control of the game, up 6-4 through two periods.</p>

<p>Yakubowski added a fifth goal in the third period, but thanks to a pair of late goals from the Tigers, the game was destined for overtime and then a shootout. Maxwell and Yakubowski failed to beat Cam Lanigan in the shootout, while Hunter Shinkaruk and Curtis Valk scored for the Tigers, giving the visitors a wild 8-7 come-from-behind victory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a tough one for us, lots of ups and downs,&rdquo; said Yakubowski after the game. &ldquo;We turned it into a slugfest which we don&rsquo;t have to do.&rdquo; The offensive output clearly wasn&rsquo;t a problem tonight, so the focus is on the team&rsquo;s collective defence. Yakubowski said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to play better defence and learn how to shut teams&rsquo; top lines down.&rdquo; He acknowledged his accomplishment, but didn&rsquo;t shy away from shouldering some of the blame for the loss, too. &ldquo;It felt good to chip in tonight, but at the same time, I was out there for a couple of goals that I should have done a couple of things differently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dan Johnston said it was &ldquo;a bunch of little things&rdquo; that caused the Hurricanes to lose control of this one. &ldquo;A couple of breakdowns in the neutral zone, odd man rushes, lack of having a third guy high. Just a couple mental mistakes put us in a position we didn&#x27;t want to be in.&rdquo; As for what needs to change for Saturday night&rsquo;s game, there was no hesitation from Johnston. &ldquo;We have to do a better job of reading the rush, and just make sure we&#x27;re keeping the puck out of the middle and using the glass if we have to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The team held an extended meeting behind closed doors after the game. When asked about what was discussed, Yakubowski emphasized accountability among the players. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all got to be accountable for each other. We all know we&rsquo;re treated well here playing in Lethbridge and sometimes some of us take that for granted a little too much.&rdquo; Johnston summarized things concisely, saying, &ldquo;Pretty plain and simple, we have to be better. Especially in front of Rimms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the defensive play in front of Rimmer was certainly an issue, the possibility that the Hurricanes&rsquo; top goalie is feeling the effects of being the busiest goalie in the WHL is now coming to mind. With 1946 minutes played so far this season, Rimmer is nearly 200 minutes clear of fellow workhorse Eetu Laurikainen of Swift Current and Luke Siemens of Prince Albert. Rimmer has also faced 18% more shots than Laurikainen, and is the only WHL goalie with more than 900 saves (1012 saves, in fact, on 1103 shots). While the coaching staff clearly have abundant faith in their veteran goalie, he has started looking overworked in the past few outings.</p>

<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise if we see Chris Tai make a couple of starts before the Christmas break to let Rimmer get rested up prior to the second half of the season. Perhaps that next start for Tai will come tonight as the Hurricanes entertain the Kootenay Ice on teddy bear night. At the other end of the rink, my money is on Jaimen Yakubowski to bring the bears down. <em>Feed the Yak and he will score</em>.</p>

<p>(What will it take to get this chant started in the Enmax?)</p>
