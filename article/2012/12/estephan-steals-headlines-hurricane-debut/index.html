        <h1>Estephan steals headlines in Hurricane debut</h1>
        <div class="byline">December 07, 2012 - by Josh Schroeder</div>
        
        <p>Fans of the Lethbridge Hurricanes got their latest glimpse of the future on Wednesday evening, and once again optimism abounds. Against the backdrop of a convincing win over the Edmonton Oil Kings, Giorgio Estephan, the Hurricanes&rsquo; top pick of the 2012 bantam draft, made sure he was noticed in his WHL debut.</p>

<p>On any other night Sam McKechnie would be making the headlines for his two goal performance that led the way in the Hurricanes&rsquo; 6-2 triumph. Indeed, McKechnie earned <em><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/8248376861/in/set-72157632178887143">the belt</a></em> from his teammates and was named first star, but the crowd of microphones after the game surrounded the 15 year old from Edmonton. Over the past three years we in Lethbridge have become familiar with the hype of top-five draft picks, and there is a certain excitement that surrounds our first look at them in a regular season game. How will this blue chip prospect fare against older, faster, and stronger opponents? It&rsquo;s all the more exciting when they happen to chip in on the scoresheet. That&rsquo;s what Estephan did on Wednesday night, eluding an Oil King defenceman to find Joel Topping&rsquo;s rebound and score a powerplay goal late in the third period.</p>

<p>Estephan is next in the stream of offensive dynamos that the Hurricanes have selected in the first round of the bantam draft, going fourth overall in 2012. He has been producing well at the midget AAA level this year, tallying 10 goals and 23 points through 17 games. That production earned him a promotion to Lethbridge to fill-in on a roster depleted by injuries and illness.</p>

<p>It was the sort of performance you&rsquo;d expect from a skilled underaged call-up, mostly keeping straight up and down the right wing flanking rookie centreman Remi Laurencelle on the fourth line. There were times, though, where Estephan looked downright comfortable playing up a level. A bit of forechecking pressure to cause a turnover, finishing a check on a puck-moving defenceman, and of course, finding space to clean up a rebound; it was a night&rsquo;s work that would thrill most rookies a year his senior.</p>

<p>Although he admitted to being &ldquo;a little bit&rdquo; nervous on the occasion of his first WHL game, Estephan&rsquo;s poise was enough to impress captain Graham Hood who said, &ldquo;15 years old and playing with men. He looked good out there, he had a lot of confidence with the puck and he worked hard.&rdquo; Maybe it was the advice that his Hurricane teammates offered before the game: &ldquo;They just said relax, play your game, and just try and do your best out there.&rdquo; The elation those teammates showed was notable after Estephan&rsquo;s goal, and he took the opportunity to soak it in. &ldquo;It was a great moment in my career. I&#x27;ll cherish this moment and that goal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To make things all the more special, Estephan&rsquo;s debut came against the team from his hometown of Edmonton. &ldquo;Normally I&#x27;m just sitting in the stands watching [the Oil Kings] back home. It was something special.&rdquo; It was certainly a memorable night for the youngster and his teammates, and it likely won&rsquo;t be the last time he steals headlines at the Enmax Centre.</p>
