        <p>After a split decision over the weekend and a lackluster performance on Saturday night, the Canes came into this game looking to make up for missed opportunities and take it to a Brandon Wheat Kings team that is flying at the moment with a 6-3-1-0 record after having just won the previous night edging a nervy one 7-6 the previous night against the tigers.</p>

<p>The Hurricanes on the other hand could only be described as under dogs in this one after a game of missed opportunities against the Saskatoon Blades saw them lose 5-2, coming into this one 3 games under 500 with a record of 3-6-0-0</p>

<p>However, stats mean nothing in the WHL and the Hurricanes came to play tonight, and play they did, hard, fast and disciplined the up shot of which meant there could be only one winner!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/8098924153/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8334/8098924153_f86d76f1a5.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<h2>Character, discipline and taken opportunities.</h2>

<p>We talk a lot about the character of this team, and have mentioned it many times with the Hurricanes. Tonight was a game where the Canes had enough character to win 2 games.</p>

<p>After falling behind to an early Wheaties goal as the scored on a 2 on 1 break, the Canes had started well, but the sucker punch of conceding an early goal has often heralded a drop of heads in the past and a line up to sit in the penalty box.</p>

<p>Tonight was not going to be one of those nights and with the Enmax still ringing from the announcement of the Brandon goal, Jay Merkley scored his second in as many games to tie things up, 1-1.</p>

<p>This goal rather than give them the comfort of being back on level terms, was the driving force to put on a determined performance that showed a first period that had no less than 23 shots and another 2 goals.
Jaimen Yakubowski mid way through the first scored the second, closely followed on the power play by Brady Ramsay, returning after his 5 game suspension looking sharp and an integral part of this team.</p>

<p>And with that the Hurricanes lead by 3 goals to 1 after 20 minutes. 
Dan Johnston was immense as ever, however he took what can only be described as a strange penalty after contributing and assist on Ramsay’s goal, when a wheat king unhappy at the Canes dominance, took a cheap shot at Dan. Not being the sort of guy to take that, he skates back and challenged the player. As he turns away the player then takes another shot with a stick to the back of Johnston&#39;s legs. As Dan remonstrated, he was called for 2 minutes for unsportsmanlike behavior, and them as he continued to protest his innocence was given a 10 minute misconduct, sitting out a larger portion of the second period. A heavy penalty to take, for a guy that did nothing more than skate to his teammates to celebrate the goal.</p>

<p>Many times in the past, as the opposition start to get chippy, the Hurricanes would often get into penalty trouble, but not tonight!!!</p>

<p>With discipline and determination, the Hurricanes stuck to their task and got set for a big second as they continued to dominate this game.</p>

<p>The Canes were flying tonight and in comparison to the last game which was a story of missed opportunities,the Hurricanes went 3 for 6 on the power play adding another power play 2 goals, from Macyo Erkamps and Dan Johnston in the second, which kept the Wheaties unable to capitalize on their opening marker, and keeping the Wheaties to 0 for 3 with the man advantage.</p>

<p>Where the last game was a story of missed opportunities, Lethbridge really made the most of their chances and added an exquisite fifth goal in the third when Russ Maxwell forced the turnover in his own zone, skated the length of the ice and with a beautiful deke, scored a goal past Honey that never tasted sweeter!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/8098924785/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8329/8098924785_961a9562b5.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<h2>The breaks</h2>

<p>After the last game where the Canes had lots of opportunities, but couldn&#39;t get a lucky bounce of the puck to finish them off, tonight they made so many chances and had such self belief, that the score could have been in double digits. </p>

<p>It was a total team performance where every line and every player stood up to be counted, working hard to create no less than 23 shots in the first period alone. </p>

<p>Brady Ramsay showed he was still sharp after sitting out for 5 games contributing at both ends.</p>

<p>Dan Johnson, our player of the game, was pivotal in the D to create a well organized and disciplined defense help out at the back to support the awesome goaltending of Ty Rimmer notching up a goal on what was his 20th birthday.</p>

<p>As Assistant Coach Matt Kabayama said after the game, “we had the momentum and took it to them!&quot;. To put it simply, the character oozed through the team and as Matt so accurately stated &quot;tonight we had the finish and we were 20 strong.&quot;</p>

<p>Next up the Hurricanes host the Kamloops Blazers and the Moose Jaw Warriors, two teams both playing well who will be sure to give the Hurricanes a challenge.</p>

<p>If they play like they did tonight, they will fear no one on the ice regadless of their reputation.</p>
