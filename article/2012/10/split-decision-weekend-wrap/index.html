        <p>The Canes were able to put down the Cougars on Friday night. A mix of solid, consistent defence and the fiery work of the Canes top line put them over the top. Outstanding plays by Axel Blomqvist, Sam McKechnie and Russ Maxwell&#39;s 2 power play goals helped the Canes bring home the 3 - 2 win.</p>

<p>The Canes looked sharp, had a jump to their step and played like they wanted this one right from the get go. There has been in past outings a sense that the Canes lose focus after the 1st period and only bring it back for the remainder of the third. Not the case in this one. If there were lapses they were covered and the Canes put on the kind of showing that makes you proud to be a fan of the Lethbridge Hurricanes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/8081712245/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8464/8081712245_436bd7601d.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<h2>What a Difference a Day Makes</h2>

<p>Still on a victory high the Canes came into this one with what had to be a boosted confidence. Unfortunately they came across a little sluggish tonight in the early periods. It didn&#39;t feel like the same team. Several turnovers and some defensive gaps later the score was 5 -1 and time was running out. A late goal by Sam (I want to call him clutch for the second of these in a row) McKechnie was a nice boost, but came a little too late as 4 was way too many to come back from this late in the game as it ended with a 5-2 loss for the Hurricanes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/8085070246/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8331/8085070246_cfe2ffd79f.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>The Canes power play needs some work. A 5 on 3 and a 5 minute major both ended without a serious chance to put one behind the wickets.</p>

<p>I will say that the weak play that led to the 4 -1 deficit going into the third did evaporate. The team all looked solid in the third. Most noticeably Duke, Watson and Merkley all found that missing jump in their step, and the chances were many and a real threat for a goal. Unfortunately Marakov was solid between the pipes and the posts didn&#39;t ring in our favour.</p>

<h2>The Positives</h2>

<p>We saw a lot of promise in the games this weekend. The defeated and disorganized play and emotions that the team had shown in some of the earlier games were not as prevalent. In fact Friday vs the Cougars they were non-existent. The Canes are starting to show some of the promise we were expecting from them early in the season. Now that we&#39;ve seen what they are capable of and as the Canes lines continue to gel, I would expect to see more W&#39;s on the stats sheet. The talent is there; let&#39;s see what happens as they start to play within Rich Preston&#39;s system.</p>

<p>Some other positives: Merkley&#39;s first goal and fiery play, McKechnie with another late goal and the speed of Jamal Watson were all welcome sights. Additionally the top lines performance on Friday was stellar.</p>

<p>We should all be looking forward to things to come</p>
