        <p>After a difficult road trip south of the border, the Hurricanes returned to the Enmax hoping to regroup, turn their fortunes around and bring everything back on track with what is seen by many Caniacs as the Hurricanes strongest roster of talent in the last couple of years.</p>

<p>With only 6 games gone in this season, this talented but young Hurricane team is still working hard to develop that sixth sense that more experienced teams, like the Raiders, have in abundance. However, there is lots of hockey still to be played and a long way to go before the teams who are destined to make the post season are decided.</p>

<p>With all this in mind, the ‘Canes came home to take on the high flying raiders who are yet to lose a game so far this season, holding a record of 6-0-0-1 before tonight’s game. The ‘Canes went into this one with a record of 2-4-0-0.</p>

<h2>Hot off the puck drop</h2>

<p>The Canes got off to the perfect start as Russell Maxwell, who continues to develop with every game, forced one in with just 21 seconds gone, with Siemens scrambling to gather the lose puck after sterling work from Jaimen Yakubowski and Axel Blomqvist, 1-0 Hurricanes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/8072928074/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8181/8072928074_94905d8e88.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>The Canes played hard during the first period, but at the Raiders settled into their rhythm, they started pressing for an equalizer, thankfully the ever reliable Ty Rimmer made save after save to ensure the Hurricanes went in with a 1 goal lead having been outshot 12-8 after the first 20 minutes.</p>

<p>The Raiders came out fired up for the second and as much as the Canes kept things tight at the back, PA were not to be kept out for long. After some sustained pressure, Winther marked his first game back after injury with a goal 4:22 into the second. PA took the lead on the power play after Rimmer cleared the puck over the glass and the ‘Canes were called for delay of game. With the Hurricanes trailing, 2-1, their assured performance from the first period was a distant memory as the Raiders showed why they are unbeaten so far this season.</p>

<p>After they took the lead, it was all Raiders as PA grew in confidence and the Hurricanes struggled at times to clear the puck. Most of the 5 shots the Hurricanes had on the PA goal tender were dump and chase opportunities with the puck failing to settle so they couldn’t get a decent shot on goal.
‘Canes went into the break trailing by a goal, 1-2 having been outshot 23-13. 
A big 3rd period was needed if the Hurricanes were going to get anything out of this game.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/8072957886/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8038/8072957886_e94c197fbf.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>The third period continued in the same vein as the second with the Hurricanes struggled to match the Raiders for speed and craft as they continued to win the battles in the middle of the ice but struggled to contain the PA offense in their own zone. Lots of effort and hard working shifts from Lethbridge, but they struggled to contain the stick work of PA who went further ahead mid way through the third as the Hurricanes chased the game.</p>

<p>Caniacs had some concern as McNeil closing in on the Hurricane net, tried to jump over Ty Rimmer, but clattered him on the way through leaving the Lethbridge goalie slow to get back up as McNeil was made to sit for goaltender interference.
Unfortunately, the ‘Canes power play was unable to pull a goal back and the score remained 3-1 Raiders.</p>

<p>Rich Preston pulled Ty Rimmer in the closing minutes in a last ditch attempt to get the Canes back into this one, but it was all for naught as the Raiders forced the turnover and with a 2 on 1 break, calmly slotted the puck into the empty net to give them a 3 goal lead, 4-1.</p>

<p>With less than a minute left in the game, there was too big a hill for the ‘Canes to climb, with the Hurricanes losing this one 4-1, having been out shot 35-20 in a game where there offence just couldn’t really get going to support their perfect start.</p>

<h2>Coming soon…</h2>

<p>The Hurricanes have a couple of weekend home games coming up as they face the Prince George Cougars on Friday, then host the Saskatoon Blades on Saturday as they look back to getting back into the win column and get the monkey off their backs.</p>

<p>From the post game locker room meeting that took place right after the game, you know that the players and coaches will leave no stone unturned to right the ship and get back to winning ways.</p>

<p>This team has way too much talent to not be able to turn things around and make the most of the chances they are getting.</p>
