        <p>The Lethbridge Hurricanes haven&rsquo;t forgotten about a winless October that sunk their playoffs hopes early last season, but they have moved past it. The Hurricanes of October 2012, while comprised of most of the same players as a year ago, are a very different team, and much like a locomotive pulling out of the station, the Hurricanes are picking up steam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Obviously it&#x27;s a learning lesson,&rdquo; said Graham Hood about last year&rsquo;s losing streak. &ldquo;Thirteen games in a row is a lot of games to lose in a row, so you take from it, but you try to forget about it. We&#x27;ve learned from it and we&#x27;re going now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Early in the year there were hints of what ailed last year&rsquo;s Hurricanes. Difficulty clearing their own zone was causing the team to rely on veteran goalie Ty Rimmer who has faced 35 or more shots on eight occasions this season, including a hectic 60 shot, 57 save night against Edmonton. Meanwhile, similar struggles plagued the offense as well, and the Hurricanes found themselves the lowest scoring team in the WHL for the first few weeks of the season. Special teams were the same story, where the &lsquo;Canes ranked at the bottom of the league in both powerplay and penalty killing efficiency.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s changed to get the <em>Cane Train</em> rolling? &ldquo;I think the biggest thing is the end time we&#x27;ve been getting lately,&rdquo; says Russ Maxwell. &ldquo;We controlled the puck down low and we&#x27;re outshooting opponents &hellip; We take the puck to the net and it&#x27;s going to go in eventually.&rdquo; And much to the delight of the lively crowds at the Enmax Centre, they have been going in with frequency over the last few weeks. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been playing really solid defensively which is transferring into offense,&rdquo; adds Hood. Maxwell also points out the importance of taking some of the heat off of Rimmer: &ldquo;[To] give him a couple of easy games, 20, 25 shots, it feels good for sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/8126654527/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8323/8126654527_01da567d2c.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>It was the likes of Maxwell along with Jaimen Yakubowski and Sam Mckechnie who kickstarted the offence, overcoming that early season inertia. Lately, though, the team has been scoring by committee, with three players tallying their first of the season last weekend. Ryan Pilon&rsquo;s being his first WHL goal, and Craig Leverton&rsquo;s first of the season followed-up soon after by his second. Hood&rsquo;s first was a long time coming. &ldquo;Nobody wants to go 15 games without scoring. It felt good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The players recognize the depth that has developed on this team, as Maxwell notes: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a bunch of good guys, four lines that can score.&rdquo; As the team&rsquo;s leading scorer, he says he&rsquo;s feeling comfortable as the primary offensive weapon, saying, &ldquo;I&#x27;ve got some pretty good confidence going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maxwell&rsquo;s linemate, big rookie winger Axel Blomqvist is still waiting for his first, and with the way he&rsquo;s played, the feeling is that he&rsquo;s due. &ldquo;He had a few shots tonight, good chances, but snakebitten. I&#x27;m sure once one comes they&#x27;re all going to come,&rdquo; said Maxwell.</p>

<p>They may be scoring goals, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean the Cane Train has gone soft. The Hurricanes&rsquo; 311 penalty minutes make them the most penalized team in the league, and Yakubowski&rsquo;s 45 are the most of any WHLer right now. According to <a href="http://hockeyfights.com">HockeyFights.com</a>, the Hurricanes currently lead the league in fights as well, with 22 tallied through 16 games, five of those belonging to Yakubowski. Perhaps it&rsquo;s captain Hood&rsquo;s leadership showing through on the style of this team, since he appreciates the rough and tumble games. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never hear me complain about playing that kind of hockey, and everyone else in our dressing room likes it, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/8126856620/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8046/8126856620_eeac05dbc2.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>What it comes down to is the identity that the Hurricanes are establishing for themselves. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve kind of given our team an identity that we&#x27;re a hard working team and hard to play against,&rdquo; says Hood. Hard working and hard to play against goes beyond just tough stuff though, and the Hurricanes are beginning to use their speed as much as their strength to win hockey games.</p>

<p>And when it comes down to it, the Cane Train moniker assigned to this team is becoming increasingly appropriate, given the speed and strength with which Hurricanes are playing.</p>
