        <p>After a lengthy BC road trip that brought an underwhelming 2-3 record and concluded with a protracted bus trip home due to poor driving conditions, the Lethbridge Hurricanes finally get to play in front of their home fans this week. Like their fans, the Hurricanes were surely happy to be back home at the Enmax Centre where their record has been an even 12-12 on the season. As for this CanesCaster, the Christmas break, a vacation, and the road trip have kept me from the rink for 39 days.</p>

<p>Tonight’s game concludes the season series between the Hurricanes and the Kootenay Ice. After losing all four against the Ice during the 2011 portion of the schedule, the Hurricanes won emphatically over the Ice, 7-2 in the first game of 2012, a game that featured Reid Duke’s first WHL goal (as a side note, the 15 year old has 4 points in his last three games. Is anybody else really excited to see him here full time next year?).</p>

<p>The Hurricanes enter this game well rested, having last played on Friday night in Kelowna. Kootenay, meanwhile, comes into the match having lost 1-0 against Brandon last night in Cranbrook. Albin Blomqvist remains out for the ‘Canes after suffering an injury in Vancouver, while Max Moline is now listed as being a week away from return.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>After being in goal for wins in Vancouver and Kelowna, Liam Liston got the call in goal again tonight for the Hurricanes, and was kept busy in the early going. After keeping the visitors at bay for 13 minutes, Liston was finally beat by a low shot from Sam Reinhart to open the scoring for the Ice. Jamal Watson evened things up a minute later after a nice breakout pass from Juraj Bezuch sent Watson up the middle, splitting the defence and beating Mackenzie Skapski with a backhand to the five hole. Joe Antilla restored the Kootenay lead moments later, going top corner to beat Liston.</p>

<p>Early in the second period John Neibrandt also found the top corner to give the Ice a 3-1 lead. Nearing the midway point of the period, Craig Leverton collected a loose puck in the crease and deposited it into the net to close the lead to 3-2. In the later stages of the period with Joe Antilla serving a hooking penalty, Jesse Ismond capitalized on a neutral zone turnover by the Hurricanes and restored the Ice’s two goal lead with a shorthanded tally. Jaimen Yakubowski potted his 10th of the season with a snipe from the slot, picking the top corner late in the frame to once again bring the Hurricanes within one at the second intermission.</p>

<p>The Hurricanes opened the third on the penalty kill and spend some time at 5-on-3 when Brady Ramsay was assessed a charging minor 14 seconds into the period. The story of the period ended up being how the Hurricanes capitalized on Kootenay’s penalties, though. With one second remaining in a too many men on the ice penalty to the Ice, Brody Sutter’s 21st goal of the season evened the score at 4 apiece. Phil Tot then gave the Hurricanes their first lead of the game with under five minutes to play while Brock Montgomery sat for hooking. The Hurricanes then killed a penalty to Tot in the dying minutes and defended well as Skapski was pulled for an extra Ice attacker. Plenty of blocked shots kept the Ice at bay and finished off the 5-4 win.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>...why the Hurricanes won. Third period special teams. The Hurricanes killed off a couple of penalties early in the period and then capitalized twice with the man advantage to overcome a game-long deficit and earn the win. After hemorrhaging shots in the opening ten minutes of the game, it was encouraging to see the team respond defensively, especially on the penalty kill, and keep Kootenay from getting shots through to Liston.</p>

<p>Russ Maxwell takes the honour tonight, getting involved in his usual scrappy fashion, generating chances, getting in the faces of his opponents, and blocking shots right down to the final buzzer.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>The Hurricanes close out the season series against the Ice with a 2-4 record, having won each of the last two meetings, and improving their home record to 13-12 along the way (and 12-4 since the beginning of November). Meanwhile, the ‘Canes have been making up some ground on some of the other non-playoff teams in the Eastern Conference standings, moving six points clear of Prince Albert and within two points of the 10th place Swift Current Broncos.</p>

<p>The Hurricanes are back in action on Friday night for Heritage Night against the Medicine Hat Tigers.
