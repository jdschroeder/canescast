<p>With Cam Braes having been traded to Moose Jaw a day before the transfer window closed, Brady became the 21st captain of the Hurricanes as they look to turn around their season and string a couple of results together. </p>

<p>The Canes hold a reasonable home record at .500 with a record of 12-12-0, but away from home their performances have cost them badly as they have won only 4 times on the road with a record of 4-15-0-1 away from the Enmax centre.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6598494585/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7031/6598494585_8bd03f0ae7_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<h2>What Happened</h2>

<p>Early pressure from the Canes as they took this game to the Cougars registering 7 shots before the hosts could register a shot on goal.</p>

<p>It was all Hurricanes for the first 8 minutes with the Canes opening the scoring 2:48 into the game via Craig Leverton scoring his second goal of the season. </p>

<p>At this point there was only one team in it, but as the Canes got into penalty trouble, the cougars scored 2 goals in just 1:05 to turn this game around having been outplayed for the majority of the first period. Canes dropped further behind with PG making the most of the man advantage going 2/3 in the first to take a 3-1 lead after 20 minutes.</p>

<p>The Hurricanes had their chances to get back into the game having a 5 on 3 chance in the second, but could not beat Drew Owsley, who was putting together a world class performance in the Cougars goal.</p>

<p>The Canes moved the puck well and got the luck they needed on the power play after Macoy Erkamps fed Captain Brody Sutter from the high slot and with a big slap shot, the Captain brought the Canes back within a goal, 3-2 </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6598496639/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7156/6598496639_400a26d349_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>It didn&#39;t last long though as almost immediately, the Cougars doubled their lead on a lucky bounce as Ketlo was beaten low on the glove side as the Cougars made it 4-2.</p>

<p>Prince George chased Damien Ketlo from the Lethbridge net as they scored their 5th goal of the night with Liam Liston taking over between the pipes on what had become an unlucky Friday the 13th for Ketz.</p>

<p>The Canes continued to press and after good pressure from Macoy Erkamps, Brady Ramsay made it 5-3 to give the Canes a glimmer of hope having outshot PG 40-27 after 40 minutes.</p>

<p>The third was a period that held great promise for the Canes, but as they got into more penalty trouble, the Cougars notched another goal after the Canes took penalty after penalty with Graham Hood literally getting 2 interference penalties pretty much back to back. Things got physical as Graham Hood and Albin Blomqvist both dropped the gloves in the final period in an attempt to get the Canes going, but at that point, they couldn&#39;t get fired up on a night where Lethbridge born Drew Owsley made 49 saves on 52 shots. 
A statistic that only served to compound the Hurricanes frustrations and close out a night that started off so well until the penalty box got in the way as they outplayed Prince George for the first half of the first period.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>Too many penalties... allowed the Cougars back in and then stopped the Canes from having enough players on the ice to turn this game around and give themselves a chance on a night where they spent too much time killing penalties.</p>

<h2><em><a href="http://lethbridgewebdesign.ca">Lethbridge Web Design</a></em> Hardest Working Hurricane: Macoy Erkamps</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6651081619/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7152/6651081619_6533a221bf_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>Working hard on the back check and getting involved in everything assisting on two of the Hurricanes goals and creating several chances in front of goal.</p>

<h2>Wrap Up</h2>

<p>A red hot Drew Owsley combined with the Hurricanes penalty trouble left them with an impossible task in overturning the Cougars lead. Hurricanes need to show more discipline and stay out of the box if they are going to give themselves a chance to get back into games like this.
Let&#39;s hope they can even things up as they come back here on Saturday.</p>

<h2>Next Up</h2>

<p>Canes look for revenge as they come back to the CN Centre tomorrow night to do it all again, Puck drops at 8:00pm</p>
