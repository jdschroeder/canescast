<p>Last time these teams met in Edmonton, the Canes won 4-3 then suffered a demoralising home loss, 10-3, days later.</p>

<p>The Canes were simply fantastic in their last game and if they could bring the same intensity to this game, they would be able to make the 10-3 loss nothing more than a distant memory.</p>

<p>Reid Duke was called up for his 7th game with the Canes still having a very short roster of players to call on, whilst Tyler Wong gets his 3rd call up.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>A lively start to what was an even and well contested game for the first 9 minutes or so as both teams created chances, with nothing really to separate them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6392862747/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7171/6392862747_ac9c9f0a4b_z.jpg" width="640" height="425" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>Lethbridge broke the deadlock midway through the period as Cam Braes picked up the puck from Nick Buonassisi and left un-marked in front of goal, moved quickly past Broissoit and slotted it into the open net, 1-0 Hurricanes.</p>

<p>Although the Canes registered the only goal of the first period, the Oil Kings came on strong and spent a large period of time camped in the Canes blue zone.</p>

<p>Damien Keltlo had a strong first period making 19 saves as the Canes went in leading by a solitary goal.</p>

<p>This was not to last as Edmonton tied it up 44 seconds gone in the second period as Wilson was left to skate unchallenged to the far post to beat Damien Ketlo low, blocker side to tie things up, 1-1.</p>

<p>Less than a minute later, things went from bad to worse, as the Oil Kings made it 2-1, both goals being scored within 1:34 of the restart.</p>

<p>Rich Preston called a time out, which steadied the ship and put the Canes back on track, at least for a little while.</p>

<p>Reid Duke scored his second WHL goal, which is sure to make the hi-light reel, as he undressed the talented and experienced Laurent Broissoit, to tie it up, 2-2.</p>

<p>Brody Sutter had several chances to put the Canes back in front, even pinging one off the cross bar on the power play, but the canes could not break the deadlock.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6392809609/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7028/6392809609_b12dbbb41b_z.jpg" width="640" height="424" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>Damien Ketlo would most likely want to have the Oil kings 3rd goal back as he was beaten high on the glove side from close in, 3-2 Oil kings.</p>

<p>Ketlo made amends soon after making a world class save as he flew across the goal, stopping the puck right on the line, to keep out Peddle who looked certain to score.</p>

<p>At the other end, Broissoit emulated Ketlo&#39;s heroics to keep out Jamal Watson after crisp passing between him and Tyler Kizuik.</p>

<p>St. Croix doubled the Oil kings lead, receiving the feed from Corbett tight in on the boards beating Ketlo high on the blocker side.</p>

<p>Tallying Edmonton&#39;s 5th goal in the period, St. Croix showed great skill as he undressed the Lethbridge defense and as Damien Ketlo stretched to make the pad save, Wruck closed in and put the rebound into the open goal.</p>

<p>Late on in the period, Cam Braes fed Landon Oslanski releasing a boomer from the slot, unfortunately Jamal Watson&#39;s tip couldn&#39;t find the net.</p>

<p>The Hurricanes conceded 5 goals in the second period to go in trailing 5-2, not what coach Preston ordered.</p>

<p>Liam Liston replaced Damien Kelto to start the third in an attempt to shore up the defence and kick start a comeback.</p>

<p>However, as the Canes pressed hard to create a goal scoring opportunity, the well organised Edmonton defense was tough to break down, as they snubbed out anything Lethbridge created.</p>

<p>Harrison Harper linked up well with Dan Johnston to set Reid Duke skating hard on goal, but his momentum ensured that he ran through on Broissoit giving him 2 minutes in the box for goaltender interference.</p>

<p>The power play proved costly for Lethbridge, as Edmonton scored once more to make it 6-2 with just under 8 minutes left.</p>

<p>Late on, Landon Oslanski scored a power play goal from the high slot to get one back for the Hurricanes after Graham Hood was upended, 6-3.</p>

<p>However, it was too little, too late, as the game ended with the Canes losing 6-3, having been outshot 41-33 in regulation.</p>

<h2>One good reason ... why the canes lost</h2>

<p>Lapses in defense leaving Damien Ketlo exposed at the back, combined with a stuttering start to the second period, left the Hurricanes with too much to do in the third to get back into this game.</p>

<h2><em><a href="http://lethbridgewebdesign.ca">Lethbridge Web Design</a></em> Hardest Working Hurricane: Landon Oslanski</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6392827627/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7026/6392827627_d116dca48e_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>Worked his socks off stepping up to protect his team mates, hustling hard and scoring a goal late on .</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>A disappointing loss after the wheels came off in the second period. 
Canes need to get back at it and not let this loss get the better of them; find their form and play as they did last game at home, against the Kootenay Ice.</p>

<h2>Next up</h2>

<p>Canes return to the Enmax on Friday night for Hall of Fame night and to take on the Medicine Hat Tigers, puck drops at 7:00pm.</p>
