        <div class="byline">January 12, 2012 - by Josh Schroeder</div>
        
        <p>The trade deadline has come and gone, with the Hurricanes pulling the trigger on a single deal: a blockbuster that sends captain Cam Braes to the Moose Jaw Warriors for a 2012 first round bantam draft pick and a 2013 second round bantam draft pick. The Warriors also added Vancouver Giants’ captain James Henry, ensuring plenty of veteran leadership for a team that has high hopes of a lengthy post-season run.</p>

<p><a href="http://martybaceda.tumblr.com/post/15580986728/braes-a-warrior">Marty Baceda from Global Lethbridge has a nice write-up about Braes over on his blog</a>, and he concludes the article with this fantastic quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While it’s hard to see Braes leave, I can’t think of a more apropos team for him to join. He’s a warrior in every sense of the word.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Make sure to read Marty’s article, because it’s a fitting tribute to Braes’ time as a Hurricane.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.canescast.ca/article/2011/12/are-hurricanes-deadline-day-sellers">When I previously predicted that Sutter would be traded and Braes would remain a Hurricane</a>, it was because I believed that Braes’ leadership was of great importance to the young core of players and worth keeping around even if a playoff push was unlikely. Braes’ now former teammates were quick to comment on Twitter about the departure of their captain, and clearly he was a guy who had earned their respect:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Best of luck to cam braes. One of the best players in the league and the best captain I&#39;ve ever had. (<a href="https://twitter.com/canescast/status/156584838097420289">Craig Leverton</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Cam Braes the best captain I have ever had you will be missed on the @WHLHurricanes #missyoubrotha (<a href="https://twitter.com/canescast/status/156554459714031616">Jamal Watson</a>)</p></li>

</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6201582858"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6173/6201582858_c1f4cd639e_z.jpg" alt="Cam Braes, all smiles after a Hurricane win"></a></p>

<p>We at CanesCast will sure miss him, but wish him luck in finishing his junior career on a high note in Moose Jaw, and in earning a chance to play professionally next season. Mark Wednesday, February 8 on your calendar, because it will be Braes’ return to Lethbridge as a member of the Warriors, and Hurricane fans will have the opportunity to thank him for his years here.</p>

<p>As for the Hurricanes organization, this deal leaves them with some options heading into the off-season. The team can hold onto these draft picks, using them to continue adding to the prospect pool in hopes of constructing a perpetual contender; however, they are in a position where they could comfortably leverage their stockpile of draft picks to trade for current value to kick-start that contender status. I myself don’t expect the Hurricanes to hold on to both of those first round picks this season, but Preston has surprised me before.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://twitter.com/paulkingsmith/status/156870125906173952">Global Lethbridge’s Paul Kingsmith reported</a> that Brody Sutter had asked Rich Preston for a trade ahead of the deadline and was “disappointed he didn’t get one.” <a href="http://lethbridgehurricanes.com/article/hurricanes-trade-deadline-recap">Rich Preston’s comment on not doing a deal</a> was that “You don’t make a deal for the sake of making a deal ... A lot of teams are vultures trying to pick over and steal players and that wasn’t going to happen. I’m not disappointed.” Despite wanting to finish the season elsewhere, Sutter will now get the opportunity to step into Braes’ leadership role after being named the Hurricanes’ captain for the remainder of the season.</p>

<p>The Hurricanes will look to start Sutter’s captaincy off on a winning note this weekend with a pair of games in Prince George, Friday and Saturday nights.</p>
