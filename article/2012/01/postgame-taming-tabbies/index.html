        <p>In a game that heralded three more inductees into the Hurricanes/Broncos Hall of Fame, the Hurricanes so dearly wanted to win this game after having suffered back to back losses to the Tigers, home and away, and having owned them for most of 2011.</p>

<p>With Hurricane HOF inductees Jamie Pushor, Jason Ruff, and Bob Barlett in attendance, the boys got to see first hand the heights you can achieve after playing junior hockey in Lethbridge.</p>

<p>Much like the previous match up, this would be a hard fought and feisty game as both teams renew their rivalry live on Shaw TV as this is broadcast across the province.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6655958027/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7034/6655958027_6057031fab_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>Tigers came out with their tails up and opened the game with sustained pressure on the Hurricane net. Canes goaltender, Damien Ketlo, played another awesome game, but the first was a master class as he stopped 18 shots including an Etam breakaway that had him performing JCVD moves to make the pad save in the splits keeping it scoreless after 20 minutes.</p>

<p>The second period was a more even affair as the Canes started to find their feet finding inspiration from their goaltenders firs period heroics. 
When Philip Tot opened the scoring after a sustained period of Hurricane pressure, there was an understandable sigh of relief. Brody Sutter had another strong game notching his 100th WHL point when he assisted on the opening goal. 
Tigers hustled late on, but couldn&#39;t force the goal that would tie it up.
The Canes were much more competitive during this period and had the majority of the chances, outshooting the tabbies 15-8.</p>

<p>The tabbies came out fast and furious for the third and tied it up early, on the power play, as the Canes got into early penalty trouble. 
However, the Canes were rewarded for their hard work when Dan Johnston scored with the man advantage, with what would turn out to be the winning goal, mid-way through the third. </p>

<p>The tigers really tried hard to battle their way back into this game, and looked certain to tie things up after more Canes penalties came late in the period. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6651082389/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7034/6651082389_822c2f35ed_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>The Canes weathered the storm killing off the penalties, and after Cam Braes left the box, he was battling for everything; Linking up with Graham Hood and Landon Oslanski, Braes&#39; scored the 3rd goal and with it recorded his 201st WHL career point, to make sure of a well deserved victory for Lethbridge.</p>

<h2>One good reason... why they won.</h2>

<p>Team spirit and the inspiration to step up their game after surviving a tough first period. Whilst this Hurricane team continues to battle, they always have a chance to score goals and win games.</p>

<h2>## <em><a href="http://lethbridgewebdesign.ca">Lethbridge Web Design</a></em> Hardest Working Hurricane: Sam McKechnie</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6655955523/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7175/6655955523_cf4c0e0305_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>For a player in his rookie season, Sam McKechnie heralds what is the new dawn of talent for the Hurricanes. He did everything tonight hustling all the way, working the boards and killing penalties.</p>

<h2>Wrap Up</h2>

<p>Back to winning ways on a true team performance where their character and integrity shone through. Great work from all of the players as they weathered the onslaught of the first to take control of the second and third periods to run out 3-1 winners.</p>

<h2>Next Up</h2>

<p>The Canes travel to Calgary on Sunday afternoon to take on the Hitmen, puck drops at 2:00pm</p>
