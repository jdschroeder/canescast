        <p>After a convincing win against the Medicine Hat Tigers, the Hurricanes made the short trip north to take on the Calgary Hitmen, full of confidence and raring to go after finding their team spirit and really starting to bond again.</p>

<p>Damien Ketlo has been outstanding in goal as he put on another world-class performance against the tabbies. The Hurricanes will be forced to split goalkeeping duties as they start the first of a six game road trip taking them to Prince George, Vancouver, Kamaloops and Kelowna before they return to the Enmax at the end of January. Liam Liston is assured of at least a couple of starts as Ketlo starts his 12th game in a row.</p>

<p>With 48 hours before the transfer deadline, this could be the last appearance for a couple of current Hurricanes, depending on what trades (if any) are made before the 10th.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6513923897/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7175/6513923897_9abf1a34cf_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>The Canes were under fire from the off as the Hitmen peppered the Lethbridge goal. 
In what has become a habit for Damien Ketlo recently, he gave a master class in goaltending, which ensured that the Canes did not concede a goal in the first 20 minutes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6514212935/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7031/6514212935_faa557a267_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>With the Canes not registering a shot until 12 minutes had passed, it appeared that the Canes would have their work cut out if they were to score against a very motivated Calgary team. But score they did as Philip Tot (21st point - same as all of last year) who was lurking behind the goal, whacked away at the side of the net, to eventually force the puck past Glover giving the Canes the 1 goal lead at the end of the first period, the Hitmen having outshot the Canes </p>

<p>Second period had the Canes starting strongly as they pressured the Hitmen goal, Cam Braes determination paid dividends as Landon Oslanski forced one home after Braes hits the cross bar. Soon after Nick Buonassisi banked one in off Helgeson as they continued to hustle for every puck.</p>

<p>With the Canes seemingly in control and the locals getting restless, the Hitmen got one back on the power play as the puck took a lucky bounce and went past Ketlo after he had stood on his head so far in this game. 
With just 17 seconds left, the Canes conceded a face off in their zone and as the puck flew high from the face-off it was deflected hightop corner, past Ketlo to make this a 1 goal game after 2 periods of play.</p>

<p>This was a great period of play by the Canes as they took this game by the scruff of the neck. However conceding 2 goals in the last 3 minutes, would make for a nervy last period as the Hitmen now had the belief that they could beat Ketlo in the Lethbridge net.</p>

<p>The third was a different story as the Hitmen stopped getting into penalty trouble as the Canes took several penalties in a row giving enough momentum to the Hitmen that they tied it up as the Erkamps penalty expired. All square and everything to play for. 3-3.</p>

<p>Another power play goal as the Hitmen shot at will as the Canes got into more penalty trouble, but had no answer to the resurgence of the Hitmen.</p>

<p>Only so much Ketlo can do as the team stopped hustling and working for each other.</p>

<p>Things got worse after sustained pressure from the hitmen, caused a turnover in the Canes zone and they extended their lead - 5-3 with less than 6 minutes to play.</p>

<p>The Hitmen made it 6 without putting the puck in the goal..... as Rich Preston pulled Damien Ketlo for the extra attacker, they shot on goal and were impeded, so a penalty goal was given allowing them to double up on the Canes.</p>

<h2>One good reason ... why the canes won/lost</h2>

<p>Switching off at the end of the second was costly, combined with the penalty trouble gave the Hitmen every chance to score and they did. 6 unanswered goals as they threw away their 3 goal lead after they looked to be cruising.</p>

<h2><em><a href="http://lethbridgewebdesign.ca">Lethbridge Web Design</a></em> Hardest Working Hurricane: Philip Tot</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6528490361/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7170/6528490361_3a6f43e480_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>Played hard, made a couple of vital back checks and hustled hard scoring a goal contributing on every shift.</p>

<p>Honorable mention to Damien Ketlo with another outstanding performance saving 41 shots, even though the Canes conceded 6.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>After a slow start the Canes took this game by the scruff of the neck, if they had kept the door closed on the Hitmen at the end of the second it would have been easy street for the third. Conceding 2 late on, made for entertaining viewing, but proved costly as the momentum shifted and stayed with the Hitmen.</p>

<h2>Next up</h2>

<p>Canes travel to northern BC to play back-to-back games against the Prince George Cougars on Friday/Saturday, 13th, 14th, puck drops at 8:00pm.</p>
