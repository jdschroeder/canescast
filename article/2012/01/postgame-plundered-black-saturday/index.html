        <p>While not mathematically make or break it, every game right now is an important one. The Canes coming off an unimpressive showing the previous night needed to step up and show the heart we&#39;ve seen in the previous months.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>The first period was an example of both strong defence from the Canes. The Canes were creative, throwing hits and generating chances, but were unable to seal the deal as Holowenko shut the door handily. Unable to capitalize on a 25 second 5 on 3 (and a total of 4 Prince Albert penalties to the Canes 1) the first period came to a close with the teams tied at 0, and the Canes ahead in shots 12 - 8.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6779698255/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7016/6779698255_750c9a57b1_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>The second period proved a different story. The first half of the second showed Prince Albert slipping 3 past Liam Liston while the Canes seemed unable to maintain strong defence in their end, getting caught running around for the first and dropping 2 goals to the  Raider&#39;s power play.The Hurricanes Tyler Kizuik and Nick Buonassisi were able to put a couple past Holowenko giving our home town boys some life and bringing them within 1. Sadly, the wind got taken out of the Canes sails in the last minute as the Josh Morrissey put away his first of 2, just outreaching Buonassisi for the centring pass. Going into the third the Canes were down by 2 (4 -2) but ahead in shots 29 - 26.</p>

<p>The first 2 minutes of the third had Prince Albert up by another as Morrisey was able solve Liston and bring the score up to 5 - 2 Raiders. Ramsay and McVeigh sitting 2 a piece for roughing decided to make a go of it, stepping out of the box and bringing out the fists. Unfortunately a short lived battle as they hit the ice quick, ending the fight and sending them to sit out the next 5.The Raiders Danyluk put the Canes up by another one increasing their lead to six. Kizuik brought the Canes back within 3 putting the booming slapper through Holowenko at the 14:45 mark, but that would do it for the period. Kizuik fanned on what could have been his hat trick, as time slipped away and the Canes could not turn their chances into goals.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6779653491/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7152/6779653491_7e87f9f009_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>At the buzzer the Canes were down 6-3 and Prince Albert was within 4 points of catching them.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>Again on this night penalties took their toll. The Canes Power Play had trouble pulling the trigger on their 6 chances going 1 for 6. For the second night in a row the Penalty Kill could not keep the puck out as the Raiders were able to score 2 of their first three on the power play allowing the Raiders to go 50% for the night (2 for 4).</p>

<p>The hardest working Hurricane honours when to to Juraj Bezuch. Juraj was strong on defence in the cause, doing well to clean up in front and was also there to lead the charge several times with crisp passing and offensive insight.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>The Hurricanes next game will be on the road in Swift Current as they face off against the Raiders on February 1st. The puck drops at 6. Follow @canescast on Twitter or at http://www.canescast.ca/game/2012-02-01 for all the Canes action.</p>
