        <p>Having lost the last 3 games, the Canes were looking to get back to winning ways and start 2012 off in the right fashion especially after dropping their last 2 games home and away to the Tigers. The Enmax which has been a fortress for the Canes recently, wasn&#39;t the happiest place last time around as they fell to the tabbies 5-2.</p>

<p>With the WHL transfer deadline day just 10 days away, the players had something to prove to ensure they stayed on the roster, so to a man this needed to be a strong performance.</p>

<p>First round draft pick, Reid Duke got called up for a 6th time after the Canes were given special dispensation by the WHL with injuries and having 3 players (Erkamps, Merkley and Leverton) playing at the word juniors. Harrison Harper also got another taste of life in the WHL as he was called up for this game.</p>

<p>Canes would have to work hard to get anything out of this game against a Kootenay Ice team that has won all 4 of the match ups this season.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6625688295/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7005/6625688295_919e3f0119_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>The game started at a good pace, but the Canes got in penalty trouble early on as Kizuik was called for a high stick. 
The Hurricanes penalty kill was proving strong and Russell Maxwell had a great short handed chance, on the rush, but could only find the side netting.</p>

<p>Reid Duke opened the scoring with his first WHL goal as he met the cross-ice pass from Jamal Watson perfectly and slotted it past Skapski at the far post. Duke&#39;s goal was met warmly by his team mates and the Enmax crowd alike, with Daniel Johnston ensuring he fished the puck out of the back of the net to give Reid a lasting souvenir of his first marker.</p>

<p>The Kootenay tieing goal was scored easily on the power play when Reinhart was allowed to skate unchallenged to the far post to slot home.</p>

<p>With their tails up the Canes continued to match-up and exceed the work rate of the Ice players. Their hard work paid off as Brody Sutter gave the Canes the lead once more, moving the puck around on the power play to create several shooting opportunities eventually leading to his goal.</p>

<p>Reinhart scored his second goal of the night midway through the second period as he rushed the net to tie things up at 2 goals a piece. That was not going to keep a hustling and fired up Hurricanes team down as they continue to press.</p>

<p>After a scramble in front, Russ Maxwell and Sam McKechnie combined well, as they did all night, with Russell getting the final touch to score the go ahead goal, 3-2.</p>

<p>Three minutes later, Philip Tot extending the lead as he got a tip on the end of a Daniel Johnston bomb from the point to make it 4-2, Hurricanes.</p>

<p>The Hurricanes were not done as Sam Mckechnie ensured the Hurricanes went in wiht a 5-2 lead after 2 periods.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6625689011/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7156/6625689011_0931f74fa2_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>In what was a very feisty and physical third, both teams did not back down from any confrontations. 
However, this time around it was the team from Cranbrook that got into penalty trouble as the Canes took advantage to score two more goals on the power play.</p>

<p>First up was Captain Cam Braes as he finished off an top class captain&#39;s performance with a goal out front after good work from Brody Sutter and Landon Oslanski behind the net.</p>

<p>Victory was sealed as Juraj Bezuch scored a beauty with the wrap around, making it 7-2 in favour of the Canes, showing Kootenay that on this night, a very different team was residing in Lethbridge.</p>

<p>Harrison Harper got his name on the game sheet after he was involved in some fisticuffs late on, as the Ice took out their frustrations dropping the gloves a couple of times in the last few minutes. Harrison proved what a great team player he is and will be a great addition to the roster when he is next called upon.</p>

<h2>One good reason ... why the canes won</h2>

<p>Character... they showed the spirit, hard work and never say die attitude that drove them back to their winning ways, prior to the Christmas break.
They showed that they were not going to be easy prey for a talented Kootenay Ice team, that even when they got feisty towards the end of the game, they covered each other backs and showed that when you take on one Hurricane you take on them all!</p>

<h2><em><a href="http://lethbridgewebdesign.ca">Lethbridge Web Design</a></em> Hardest Working Hurricane: Reid Duke</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6625689933/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7026/6625689933_7038bc5225_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>With his first WHL goal and an assists, Reid showed that even though he can&#39;t currently play a full season with the Hurricanes, he is not out of place playing on this team and once he gets to join the roster full-time next season, he will be a force to be reckoned with and a real talent for years to come.</p>

<p>Close contenders in this one were Sam McKechnie who continues to improve, Phil Tot, Cam Braes, Brady Ramsay, Russell Maxwell, and Daniel Johnston, all of which could have been sitting in Reid&#39;s place as the hardest worker.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>Having re-found the character and team spirit, the Canes need to continue to dig deep to restore the hustle and team ethics that gave them much success prior to the festive break and get them back to winning ways in 2012. </p>

<h2>Next up</h2>

<p>The Hurricanes head north on Wednesday to take on the Edmonton Oil Kings as they look for revenge after their 10-3 loss at the Enmax centre back in November. Game time is 7:00pm, Wednesday 4th January.</p>
