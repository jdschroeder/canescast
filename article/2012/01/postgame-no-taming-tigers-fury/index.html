        <div class="byline">January 28, 2012 - by Morgan Martin</div>
        
        <p>Sitting twelve points out of eighth place in the Eastern Conference and leading the Tigers season series 3 - 2, the Canes came into this game needing the win to help keep the playoff dream alive. With historical Lethbridge Sugar Kings in attendance (including the accomplished Lanny McDonald offering the team his words of wisdom) tonight was the perfect chance to showcase Lethbridge pride and hockey prowess.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>The game started a little ominously with Erkamps getting the first penalty of the game in the first minute. The Canes managed to hold the Tigers to one shot on the power play, but this was not to prove the rule.</p>

<p>The Canes were able to generate some chances in the first couple minutes, but the opening salvo when to Etam as the Tigers opened the scoring just shy of the 5 minute mark of the first. The Canes followed the goal with a flurry in front of Bunz, but were unable to tie the game. Midway through the period Ramsay took a high sticking penalty and the tigers leapt at the chance putting themselves up by two. McKay of the Tigers took two minutes for Hooking giving them their first penalty of the game. On the ensuing penalty the Canes were able to find twine as Brody Sutter took the feed from Brady Ramsay and slid it past Bunz to bring the Canes back within one.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6774817535/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7022/6774817535_a9c0b490ac_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>First period scoring wasn&#39;t done there as the Tigers Valk would again give them a cushion. The Canes brought the game back to  3 -2 as Merkley was able to push another one between the arm and chest of Bunz off the assistance of Oslanski and Tot. A couple coincidental minors ended the first, and there seemed to be room for the Canes to take this game as a &quot;W&quot;. Unfortunately two in the first ended the Canes goal scoring on this evening. </p>

<p>The second period showed some good back and forth play and a few crushing hits, but by the end the Tigers had put themselves up by two with Bettauer able to put one past Ketlo high, glove side, on the power play while Erkamps sat for hooking. The only fight of the game came in the second, but that ended without much fanfare as neither player could get the fists out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6777566601/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7157/6777566601_9bff7196d9_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>The third period was forgettable. The tigers struck 4 more times for 5 unanswered goals including three more penalty situation goals, the hardest to take being short handed. Ketlo played well through the majority of the third under a flurry of shots, but another goal by Etem in the second minute seemed to give the Tigers the impetus to shut down the Canes completely. When the bleeding was done Etem came away with 4 points including the hat trick as the Canes dropped this one handily, allowing the Tigers to even up the season series.</p>

<p>A grudging glade at the score board after the final buzzer showed the Tigers led 8 - 2 and had outshot the Canes 44 - 25.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>It seemed that the Canes players were a little out of energy and not up for this one. The boost from Lanny and the Sugar Kings we all hoped for did not seem to materialize.</p>

<p>Ketlo seemed a little unsure with the puck at times, The Tigers were able to skate in front seemingly at will and there seemed to be no finish. </p>

<p>Ultimately, from my point of view, the most outstanding issue seemed to be the parade to the box. 8 penalties to the Tigers five and poor penalty killing gave the Tigers all the chance they need to get ahead and not look back.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6777680659/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7171/6777680659_9bed8b8006_z.jpg" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>Tonight we went with Jay Merkley for the hardest working Hurricane. He was able to put one past Bunz, and showed life where others did not in the losing cause.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>If the Hurricanes are going to have a shot at the post season they will need to tighten up defensively and show more energy and spirit then they did against Medicine Hat. Hosting the Prince Albert Raiders tonight is going to be an important test of the Hurricane metal. Game time is 7 at the Enmax. Call (403) 329 - SEAT for tickets.</p>
