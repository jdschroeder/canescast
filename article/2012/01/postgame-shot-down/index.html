        <div class="byline">January 18, 2012 - by Josh Schroeder</div>
        
        <p>Flying high after a big win in Vancouver last night, the Hurricanes look to move their record to .500 on their BC road swing as they roll into Kamloops to play the BC division leading Blazers. These two teams met in Lethbridge back in October with the Blazers coming away with a 7-4 victory.</p>

<p>Notable injuries coming into this one include Brandon Herrod for the Blazers and Albin Blomqvist for the Hurricanes. Blomqvist went awkwardly into the boards last night in Vancouver and did not return to the game.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>The Hurricanes got off to a quick start, putting the Blazers back on their heels for the first six minutes or so of the game, but were kept off the scoresheet by goaltender Cole Cheveldave. After being unable to capitalize on a bunch of chances, the Hurricanes conceded the opening goal when Damien Ketlo played a puck behind the net and wasn’t able to get back between the pipes in time to stop Brendan Ranford from slapping home a pass from Chase Shaber. From there the Blazers took over the momentum, putting the Hurricanes back on their heels.</p>

<p>The trend continued into the second period with the Hurricanes unable to establish any pressure, or even a shot on goal for the first twelve minutes of the period. Chase Souto doubled the Blazer lead five and a half minutes into the period, providing a screen in front of Ketlo and then sliding the rebound under his pad. Ten minutes later Tim Bozon finished off a nice passing play with Marek Hrbas to extend the lead to 3-0. The Blazers then kept the Hurricanes at arm’s length for the duration of the third period as it seemed the visitors were out of steam and unable to mount any sort of comeback.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>...why the Hurricanes lost. Whether due to fatigue or just letting up, the Hurricanes quit skating in this one. They got trapped in their own zone for good portions of the night and didn’t drive to the scoring areas on the occassions when they did find themselves in Blazer territory. It was a strong effort for the opening ten minutes or so, but after that they trailed off and were never able to regain their step while Kamloops controlled the final 50 minutes.</p>

<p>Dan Johnston takes the honour tonight, having a pretty good game in his own end of the rink, but also moving the puck through the neutral zone well and laying the body to the Blazers a number of times. It wasn’t his most outstanding game of the season, but it was a well rounded effort.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>One more game left on the road trip, in which the Hurricanes have so far posted a disappointing 1-3 record. We can hope that the ‘Canes can find their legs again before Friday night’s tilt in Kelowna against the Rockets, a team with whom they should be competitive with.</p>

<p>With the hope of remaining in the playoff hunt quickly fading (and perhaps already admitted to by trading away Cam Braes), I can’t help but wonder if we will see Liam Liston given more starts to prepare him for the apparent starting role that he will inherit next season. Perhaps we will see him back in goal as soon as Friday in Kamloops. That one is a 8:05 start time for those following along back in Lethbridge.</p>
