        <p>Five games in eight nights in BC comes to an end tonight in Kelowna against the Rockets. As suspected, Liam Liston gets the start in goal for the second time in the week after a strong performance in the win over Vancouver on Tuesday. Albin Blomqvist and Max Moline remain on the injured list as the Hurricanes’ two scratches.</p>

<p>Last time these teams met was in Kelowna back on December 7 at the start of another BC road swing. The Rockets would win by a 5-2 score on that evening. The Rockets come into the game firmly entrenched in 6th place in the Western Division, seven points back of Spokane and eight up on Seattle. The Hurricanes’ recent resurgence has them with only two fewer wins than the Rockets on the season.</p>

<p>Would the Hurricanes get to enjoy a happy bus ride back to Lethbridge?</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>Much like in Kamloops on Wednesday night, the Hurricanes got a good jump in the the first period and started generating opportunities early, and got the support they needed from Liston when he was tested early. Nearing the midway point of the first period Russ Maxwell made a backhand pass from the top of the circle to Sam Mckechnie all alone in front of the Rockets’ net. Mckechnie made no mistake and picked the top corner glove side on Kelowna starter Jordon Cooke to give the Hurricanes a 1-0 lead. Cooke performed well for the opening frame, stopping 17 of 18 shots that the Hurricanes directed his way in the opening 20 minutes.</p>

<p>The second period opened with a bang, as Brody Sutter beat Brett Bulmer to a puck in the Rockets’ zone, quickly snapping it by Cooke to give the Hurricanes a 2-0 lead. Moments later Jamal Watson slid a pass to Sutter who caught Cooke moving the wrong direction and put the 3-0 goal inside the left post. Hardly more than a minute after that Brady Ramsay sent a centering pass in the direction of Graham Hood, but before the pass could find its target, a Kelowna player deflected it into the net, giving the Hurricanes a sudden 4-0 lead and chasing Cooke from the Rockets’ crease. Midway through the period after Landon Oslanski carried the puck into the zone, Phil Tot collected the biscuit and fired a rocket to the top corner stick side to give the Hurricanes a 5-0 lead.</p>

<p>While the Rockets could have given in at this point, they responded to the deficit by pushing back, and were able to get on the scoresheet on the powerplay with 5:15 remaining in the period when Jesse Lees fired a point shot that made its way through traffic and past a screened Liston. Before the period would expire, a Colten Martin shot fired wide of the net took a lively bounce off the end boards, giving Colton Scissons a wide open net with Liston caught on the opposite post. The Hurricanes lead 5-2 at the second intermission.</p>

<p>Third period action began with wide open action as the Rockets looked to get back in the game and the Hurricanes counter attacked early and then settled in to defend the lead. The Rockets appeared to score one approaching the seven minute mark of the period, but the officials ruled that Tyrell Goulbourne interfered with Liston and assesed him a penalty instead. Kelowna did cut the lead to 5-3 with 2:50 to play, but Graham Hood countered with an open net goal in the final minute to seal the 6-3 victory.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>...why the Hurricanes won. They won the battles for the puck for most of the game. Winning possession and generating shots from the outset put the Hurricanes in the driver’s seat.</p>

<h2><em><a href="http://lethbridgewebdesign.ca">Lethbridge Web Design</a></em> Hardest Working Hurricane</h2>

<p>At the risk of looking like we pick this award based on stats, Brody Sutter gets the honour tonight. He controlled play in the first period with his size and created chances with his skill. It paid off in the second period when he racked up two goals and an assist in a span of 3:27. Based on his do-it-all play tonight, the Kelowna play-by-play team joked he would be driving the team bus home after the game, too. That’s the sort of game we want to see from Sutter.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>All-in-all it was an impressive effort from the Hurricanes tonight, featuring some strong individual performances, and punctuated by a 42 count on the shot clock. The Hurricanes’ record now improves to 18-30-0-1 on the year, leaving them only five wins away from their total from last season.</p>

<p>Back aboard the happy bus now, the Hurricanes are en route to Lethbridge where they will have a few days to prepare for Wednesday night when they host the Kootenay Ice at the Enmax Centre. That game will kick off a busy stretch for the organization. On Thursday night the Hurricanes will host the seventh annual celebrity sports dinner and auction, featuring Clark Robertson, a comedian and Don Cherry impersonator. Proceeds from the event support local organizations which have previously included the United Way, the Kidney Foundation of Canada, and the Michael Maniago Memorial Fund. <a href="http://lethbridgehurricanes.com/article/7th-annual-celebrity-sports-dinner-auction/113762">For more information on the dinner, visit the Hurricanes’ web site</a> or call Trudi in the Hurricanes’ office at (403)328-1986. The Hurricanes will get back at it on home ice on Friday night against Medicine Hat and Saturday against Prince Albert.
