        <p>Oh the storylines! There was plenty going on heading into tonight’s match-up between the Lethbridge Hurricanes and Vancouver Giants at the Pacific Colosseum. Going into this game, the Hurricanes remained winless since trading Cam Braes, and were riding a three game losing skid into Vancouver. Meanwhile, their last game here was a win that snapped a seven year losing streak against the Giants.</p>

<p>On the Giants’ side, a couple of familiar faces recently took up residence: Russian winger Alex Kuvaev, who spent last season with the Hurricanes, has played eight games with Vancouver since joining them after the Christmas break, tallying a goal and five assists in that span; Additionally, Austin Fyten now finds himself a Giant after being released by the Hurricanes prior to deadline day. Fyten isn’t yet skating with the Giants, but is rehabbing his injured knee in hopes of returning in late March or early April in time to contribute to a playoff drive.</p>

<p>The injury bug has hit the Giants hard lately, a story the Hurricanes know all too well. World Junior competitors Brendan Gallagher and David Musil, arguably the team’s top forward and defenseman respectively, as well as starting goalie Adam Morrison and Dalton Sward are all currently out of the line-up with upper body injuries. The Hurricanes come into the game relatively healthy with an opportunity to take advantage of a depleted opposition.</p>

<h2>What Happened?</h2>

<p>The game opened in a wide-open fashion with a bit of sloppy play by each side, and plenty of shots and chances as a result. Just over two minutes into the game, Adam Henry dropped the gloves with Scott Cooke for a brief fight at center ice. Cooke landed a right to the back of Henry’s helmet to knock him down and end the fight before the Hurricane could deliver a notable punch. Seconds after play resumed, Phil Tot forced a turnover behind the Vancouver net and fed the puck out front to Jay Merkley who had plenty of time to set up his shot and bury the opening goal. At the midway point of the period Russ Maxwell put a shot off the outside of the post on a good opportunity for the Hurricanes that quickly transitioned the other way and resulted in a Jordan Martinook goal as he beat a sprawled Liam Liston who had dove to stop a shot that was blocked. Tot’s strong puck pursuit continued and resulted in another goal after forcing a turnover in the neutral zone and then carrying the puck down the left wing to set up Nick Buonassisi for a nice tip past Jackson Whistle to regain the Hurricane lead. Vancouver evened things up again late in the period as a delayed penalty was to be called against the Hurricanes. A blast from the point was redirected in the slot and beat Liston to the five hole.</p>

<p>The Hurricanes capitalized on the powerplay five minutes into the second, again with Tot feeding the puck from behind the net, this time to Buonassisi to slid it across to Merkley who had a wide open net in which to burry his second goal of the game, and tenth of the season. The lead held until early in the third period when the Hurricanes were unable to clear the zone on a penalty kill and Marek Tvrdon chipped one between Liston’s pads to tie the game at three. Moments later the Hurricanes capitalized on the rush when Jamal Watson fed a pass wide from the right wing across the low slot to Yakubowski on the opposite wing who then threaded the needle to beat Whistle as his defenceman Neil Manning came crashing into the net while Sam Mckechnie provided a presence in front of the goal. A brief video review confirmed that the net had not been displaced before the puck crossed the goal line, and Yakubowski’s go-ahead goal stood.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6514057481/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7003/6514057481_d512009d63_z.jpg" alt="Mckechnie and Yakubowski celebrate a goal"></a></p>

<p>Some good pressure from the Giants was snuffed out by an unnecessary penalty by Taylor Makin for making contact with Liam Liston. The Hurricanes used the ensuing powerplay to turn the pressure the other way, and after a wild scramble at the top of the crease, Tot was able to shovel the puck over a down-and-out Whistle to extend the Hurricanes’ lead to 5-3. With the Giants’ net empty in the dying seconds of the third period, Tot managed to strike again from well inside his own zone, capping off a five point night and a 6-3 victory. Liam Liston looked sharp in goal throughout the evening, turning aside 38 of 41 Vancouver shots to earn the victory.</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>... why the Hurricanes won. Given the context of the last few games: discipline. They managed to stay out of the penalty box, played a good road game and took advantage of their opportunities against a team that was lacking a number of their star players. Liston played well, but it didn’t feel like he had to be outstanding for the team to win on this occassion. Spending less time killing penalties is a big contributor to taking a load off of the goalie and helping him earn that win.</p>

<p>It could be none other than <strong>Phil Tot</strong> tonight. The whole line of Tot, Buonassisi, and Merkley looked good, but it seemed to me that much of that was driven by how well Tot was generating chances. He generated a bunch of turnovers deep in Giant territory and in the neutral zone and then made good plays to create scoring opportunities from them. Had Whistle not robbed him one a doorstep pass from Russ Maxwell in the first period, Tot may well have netted a hat trick tonight. Perhaps it was the big city and the scouts that coaxed a big performance out of the draft eligible winger, but whatever the case, I want to see more performances like that from Tot.</p>

<h2>Wrap Up</h2>

<p>Seven years without a win against the Giants feels like a distant memory for the Hurricanes now, as they sweep the two games against the Giants this season. The victory brings the Hurricanes’ road win total up to five, although they’ve still only managed to win in three buildings other than the Enmax Centre this season (Medicine Hat twice, Vancouver twice, Red Deer once). The road wins have been hard to come by, but the ‘Canes will try to string a couple together with a quick turnaround and a game Wednesday night in Kamloops against the BC Division leading Blazers. Game time for that one is 8:00 Lethbridge time.</p>
