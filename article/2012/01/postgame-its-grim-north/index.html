<p>After getting chased last night, Rich Preston kept faith with Damien Ketlo, starting him two nights running as he made his 13th consecutive start for the Hurricanes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6528491363/" title="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7173/6528491363_40440e12de_z.jpg" width="640" height="425" alt="Lethbridge Hurricanes game photo"></a></p>

<p>Lethbridge born, Drew Owsley also started in goal for the second consecutive night, as the Canes hoped to catch him on an off night, after he stood on his head the night before stopping 49 of the 52 shots he faced.</p>

<h2>What Happened</h2>

<p>An evenly balanced start to the game as both sides had a couple of chances, with nothing of note. The nearest either side got to scoring early on, was hitting the steel.
Both teams had chances with the man advantage, and although Lethbridge had 6 shots on goal, they couldn&#39;t beat Owsley who was having another good night in goal for PG.</p>

<p>The Cougars broke the deadlock, as they took the lead late in the period with Siwak beating Damien Ketlo after he followed in on Bourke&#39;s rebound. </p>

<p>Other than the PG goal, both goalies had a good first period with both of them making some excellent saves to keep their respective teams in the game.</p>

<p>The second started with the Cougars hustling as they soon caught up on the shot clock after Spencer Galbraith was called for boarding. 
Canes stood strong killing off the penalty and with good stick work from Buonassisi and Ramsay, created several chances the other way.
However, once again, Owsley was putting up tough resistance for the second time in 2 nights. 
Things were again, relatively even for most of the second as both sides had chances, with neither side having the upper hand.</p>

<p>Canes were struggling to put pressure on the PG goal, as they did not have a player following up and looking for rebound opportunities.</p>

<p>With another strong period, the Canes couldn&#39;t break down Owsley as he saved all 23 shots he had faced.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6201020159/" title="Brady Ramsay fires a wrist shot by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6159/6201020159_f96da2a9e8_z.jpg" width="640" height="512" alt="Brady Ramsay fires a wrist shot"></a></p>

<p>Canes started the third brightly and as they started to press forward looking for the tieing goal, Brady Ramsay followed up on a big wrister from Dan Johnston to sneak one in off the post and tie it up 1-1.</p>

<p>Cougars re-took the lead a couple of minutes later as they caught the Canes looking, forcing the turnover and leaving Damien Ketlo with little chance of making the save on the rush.
Cougars extended their lead on the power play as Landon Oslanski was penalized for holding. 
A tough couple of minutes as the Canes conceded two goals in 1:37. </p>

<p>The Hurricanes continued to hustle and chase every puck. Lots of individual skill was on show as Watson, Erkamps and Bezuch skated through the PG defense, but couldn&#39;t get a shot on the goal.
With a rocket off the cross bar PG extended their lead, 4-1, pretty much ending any chance the Canes had to get back into this one.</p>

<p>Jay Merkley scored a really nice individual goal as he forced the turnover and stole it by the benches, then skated hard and with a flick of the wrist, beating Owsley high glove side, to bring it back within 2. 
Unfortunately, there was still a lot to do for the Canes to get back into this one with only 58 seconds left in the game.</p>

<p>A 4-2 loss was how it finished in what was a disappointing night for the Canes. This game was one the Canes should have won, outshooting the Cougars 41-27 over 60 minutes, but the Canes just couldn&#39;t find the back of the net</p>

<h2>One good reason</h2>

<p>A couple of tough goals, but another outstanding night of goal tending from Drew Owsley. Canes need to get back to rushing the net and following up on the rebound if they are to turn pressure and shots into goals.</p>

<h2><em><a href="http://lethbridgewebdesign.ca">Lethbridge Web Design</a></em> Hardest Working Hurricane: Juraj Bezuch</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canescast/6290572838/" title="Juraj Bezuch by CanesCast - Lethbridge Hurricanes game photos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6098/6290572838_0be404389f_z.jpg" width="640" height="512" alt="Juraj Bezuch"></a></p>

<p>Lots of hustle as he kept asking questions of Owsley and drove his team forward time and time again in what was a losing cause.</p>

<h2>Wrap Up</h2>

<p>After last night&#39;s penalty issues, the Canes kept their heads but a couple of mistakes and another strong performance from goal tender, Drew Owsley, gave the Canes too much to do late in the game. The Hurricanes had 93 shots on goal over the 2 games and yet lost both nights being doubled up 6-3 and 4-2 respectively. 
Time for the Canes to dig deep, find their character and go slay the giants.</p>

<h2>Next Up</h2>

<p>Canes continue on their road trip as they travel to Vancouver to take on the Giants in the Coliseum, Tuesday 17th January - puck drops at 8:00pm</p>
