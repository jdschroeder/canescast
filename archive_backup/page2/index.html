      <h2><a href="/article/2013/09/saying-goodbye-to-good-players/">Saying goodbye to good players</a></h2>
      <p><em>September 27, 2013</em> - Once or twice I’ve found myself at the end of training camp, sitting across the table from a coach or general manager. Without fail, they always made sure to remind me that cutting players was the worst part of their job. I suppose even though the decision to cut <em>me</em> was easy, breaking that news to a player can still be unpleasant. Sometimes, though, a team has to make a genuinely difficult decision to part ways with a player. This season the Hurricanes faced just that situation.

      <p><em>August 28, 2013</em> - Do you remember the TV series <em>Making the Cut</em> that aired on CBC during the 2004 NHL lockout? It was a reality series with 68 hockey players vying for one of six try-out opportunities with a Canadian NHL club. Hockey fans in Lethbridge had the opportunity to cheer for towering U of L Pronghorns defenceman James Demone who succeeded in earning a try-out opportunity with the Vancouver Canucks.

      <h2><a href="/article/2013/08/three-players-to-watch/">Three Players to Watch</a></h2>
      <p><em>August 26, 2013</em> - Now that I’ve finally come to a sense of closure on the Rich Preston era, it’s time to look forward with optimism on the upcoming season. There are three players that I am keen to see in action this season, because I think they are capable of greater than we’ve seen from them. Here is my short list of three returning players to watch on the Hurricanes this season.

      <h2><a href="/article/2013/08/what-went-wrong/">4 Seasons Under Rich Preston: What Went Wrong?</a></h2>
      <p><em>August 25, 2013</em> - In the summer of 2009, just a year removed from an appearance in the WHL finals, the Hurricanes opted not to renew head coach Michael Dyck, while also cutting ties with general manager Roy Stasiuk. Rich Preston, coming off of a five season stint as an assistant coach with the Calgary Flames, was hired to fill both vacant positions. Before we turn our focus toward the new season ahead, I thought I would take one final look at the Hurricanes’ performance over the four seasons under the performance of Rich Preston.
