# CanesCast

CanesCast.ca was a fan-built website providing an alternative look at the 
[Lethbridge Hurricanes](http://www.lethbridgehurricanes.com). It was operated from 2009-2014, after which
it was retired so the founders could move on to other interests. This repository and the resulting GitHub Pages
site are maintained as a look back at our time as CanesCast.
