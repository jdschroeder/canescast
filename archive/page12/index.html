      <h2><a href="/article/2011/12/are-hurricanes-deadline-day-sellers/">Are the Hurricanes deadline day sellers?</a></h2>
      <p><em>December 29, 2011</em> - The WHL trade deadline is fast approaching, and after a quiet WHL transaction wire through most of December, the trades have now started to signal a beginning to the deadline season. As one of the teams likely to miss the playoffs the Hurricanes may be considered <em>sellers</em> when it comes to deadline day. Before we speculate as to what might happen for the Hurricanes prior to or on January 10, let&rsquo;s take a look at Rich Preston&rsquo;s trade history in the month or so leading up to the trade deadline for the last two years.

      <p><em>December 27, 2011</em> - Fresh off a brief Christmas break, the Hurricanes opened the unofficial second half of the season Tuesday evening in Cranbrook against the Kootenay Ice. As has been the case several times this season, the Hurricanes iced an incomplete line-up dues to a number of absences. Tyler Kizuik and Max Moline are still sidelined with injuries, Juraj Bezuch is out serving a suspension for the cipping major against Swift Current, and three outstanding rookies – Erkamps, Merkley, and Leverton – are in Windsor, Ontario to compete in the World U17 Hockey Challenge. Harrison Harper received the call-up for his WHL debut, bringing the Hurricanes to 16 skaters, two short of a full line-up.

      <h2><a href="/article/2011/12/mapping-first-half-playoff-race/">Mapping the first half playoff race</a></h2>
      <p><em>December 20, 2011</em> - The most compelling storyline around the Lethbridge Hurricanes at the mid-way point of the season is the impressive turnaround that they’ve put together since the end of October. As we’ve been hearing lately, the ‘Canes have gone from being 23 points out of a playoff spot to only eight back at the Christmas break. Not that I want to pour cold water on the recent turnaround, but it isn’t entirely accurate to say that the Hurricanes have made up 15 points in the playoff race. Here’s why:

      <p><em>December 19, 2011</em> - Last game before the Christmas break and teddy bear toss night, the Canes had every reason to put on a show and enter the festive break with a big win against a team that has beaten them twice so far this season.

      <p><em>December 17, 2011</em> - After a game earlier in the month where the Hurricanes led the Royals going into the third and a close call December 14 where another lead slipped away but they managed to get the last minute tie and the quick win in OT against the Hitmen; the Canes were looking to show a more consistent effort and continue to puts some numbers in the W column. The Royals are coming off 2 defeats since beating the Canes and are looking to get some momentum as we approach the holiday break.

      <p><em>December 11, 2011</em> - How about a trivia question? How many players have captained the Lethbridge Hurricanes since they last beat the Vancouver Giants? Would you believe six? Brent Seabrook was captain last time the ‘Canes beat the Giants (although he was playing for Team Canada at the World Juniors when the game took place, so Mark Ashton was wearing the ‘C’ on that night). Ashton, Kris Hogg, Ben Wright, Carter Bancks, and Mike Reddington have served as captains since that win in Vancouver on December 28, 2004. Could this year’s team led by Cam Braes put an end to a seven year losing streak?

      <p><em>December 07, 2011</em> - With back to back top class goaltending from Liam Liston and Damien Ketlo over the last couple of games, Rich Preston had the difficult choice of which goaltender to start against the Kelowna Rockets for what would be the first of a three game BC road trip.
