      <h2><a href="/article/2011/12/postgame-blades-glory/">Postgame: Blades of glory</a></h2>
      <p><em>December 04, 2011</em> - With a resurgence worthy of a Hollywood movie, the Lethbridge Hurricanes played host to the Saskatoon Blades having won 5 of their last 7 giving them a record thus far of 8-20-0-1. Quite the turnaround from the start of the season that saw them win 2 of their first 3, then go on a 13 game losing streak.

      <h2><a href="/article/2011/12/postgame-clawing-back/">Postgame: Clawing Back</a></h2>
      <p><em>December 01, 2011</em> - The Lethbridge Hurricanes’ month of November came to a close Wednesday night in Medicine Hat against the rival Tigers. Life didn’t look any easier coming into this game; Phil Tot joins Macoy Erkamps and Daniel Johnston as recently injured, and Graham Hood sits out after being suspended for a hit on Josh Cowen on Tuesday night. On a positive note, Juraj Bezuch and Albin Blomqvist return after missing a game due to the flu. The injury situation resulted in Cam Braes moving back to defence again tonight.

      <p><em>November 29, 2011</em> - For the third time in six games, the Hurricanes went up against the Red Deer Rebels on Tuesday night. The Hurricanes’ 5-1 win that featured five fights was surely fresh in everyone’s mind as the Rebels looked to avoid a sweep of the three game set and an extension of a five game winless streak that has seen them drop from the top of the conference down to seventh.

      <h2><a href="/article/2011/11/postgame-bounce-back/">Postgame: Bounce back</a></h2>
      <p><em>November 25, 2011</em> - After stringing together consecutive wins for the first time this season, the Hurricanes were handed an embarrassing 10-3 defeat at the hands of the Edmonton Oil Kings on Wednesday night. Tonight brought another formidable challenge, facing the Red Deer Rebels on the road. The last time the Hurricanes won a game at the Enmax Centrium was January 31, 2009 (fun fact: Michael Tadjdeh earned a 38 save shut out on that evening). The Hurricanes also hadn’t managed a win on the road since the season opener in Medicine Hat back in September, so a long losing streak could be broken tonight.

      <p><em>November 18, 2011</em> - This one didn&#39;t look good on paper: The Hurricanes on a five game losing streak, losers of of 18 games since the beginning of October; The Rebels atop the WHL&#39;s central division; Red Deer having beaten Lethbridge 4-1 and 5-0 in their previous meetings this season. On the surface, this one looked like an easy one for the Rebels.

      <p><em>November 13, 2011</em> - After working their socks off last night and getting nothing for their efforts, the Canes took the short journey north to take on local rivals, Calgary Hitmen. A team they had the measure of last time around, edging a goal fest in their home opener, 6-5.

      <p><em>November 13, 2011</em> - In a difficult match up that saw the number 3 ranked team in the CHL take on the Hurricanes, who have won just 1 in their last 17, it was always going to be an uphill task.

The Canes sported their Military appreciation jersey, adorned with a gold ribbon and camouflage to pay respects to those who battle overseas to fight for our freedom.

      <p><em>November 07, 2011</em> - It&#39;s that time of year again: Movember. The month where junior hockey players all over the WHL come to Lethbridge and spoil my photos with terrible moustaches. I give them a pass, though, because they&#39;re doing it for a good cause.

      <p><em>November 02, 2011</em> - It was a terrifying month of October for the Lethbridge Hurricanes, capped off with a 5-0 loss to the Red Deer Rebels on Saturday. Thirteen losses and an 0-12-0-1 record in the month of October have the Hurricanes anxious for a fresh start and some positive results as the calendar turns over on a new month.
