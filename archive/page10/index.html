      <p><em>January 28, 2012</em> - Sitting twelve points out of eighth place in the Eastern Conference and leading the Tigers season series 3 - 2, the Canes came into this game needing the win to help keep the playoff dream alive. With historical Lethbridge Sugar Kings in attendance (including the accomplished Lanny McDonald offering the team his words of wisdom) tonight was the perfect chance to showcase Lethbridge pride and hockey prowess.

      <p><em>January 27, 2012</em> - As you have probably heard, Lanny McDonald is in town for Heritage Night this evening where he and several other Lethbridge Sugar Kings alumni will be honoured in a pre-game ceremony. Even better, Lanny spoke at last night’s Celebrity Sports Dinner and Auction, telling stories of his playing days in Lethbridge, Toronto, Colorado, and Calgary. All evening, Lanny was happily sharing stories, posing for photos, and signing autographs.

      <p><em>January 26, 2012</em> - After a lengthy BC road trip that brought an underwhelming 2-3 record and concluded with a protracted bus trip home due to poor driving conditions, the Lethbridge Hurricanes finally get to play in front of their home fans this week. Like their fans, the Hurricanes were surely happy to be back home at the Enmax Centre where their record has been an even 12-12 on the season. As for this CanesCaster, the Christmas break, a vacation, and the road trip have kept me from the rink for 39 days.

      <p><em>January 21, 2012</em> - Five games in eight nights in BC comes to an end tonight in Kelowna against the Rockets. As suspected, Liam Liston gets the start in goal for the second time in the week after a strong performance in the win over Vancouver on Tuesday. Albin Blomqvist and Max Moline remain on the injured list as the Hurricanes’ two scratches.

      <p><em>January 19, 2012</em> - It’s been a while since I&#39;ve done a Freeze Frame article, and that means that I’ve neglected some photos that I was pretty excited to share from back in November. On November 9th the Hurricanes hosted the Seattle Thunderbirds on <em>Military Appreciation Night</em>.

      <p><em>January 18, 2012</em> - Flying high after a big win in Vancouver last night, the Hurricanes look to move their record to .500 on their BC road swing as they roll into Kamloops to play the BC division leading Blazers. These two teams met in Lethbridge back in October with the Blazers coming away with a 7-4 victory.

      <p><em>January 18, 2012</em> - Mark your calendars for Friday, January 27, as the Hurricanes’ 25th anniversary celebrations will continue in their game against the Medicine Hat Tigers. The ‘Canes will sport throw-back uniforms for “Heritage Night”, wearing Lethbridge Sugar Kings colours and welcoming former Sugar King (and Tiger, as a matter of fact) and Hockey Hall of Famer Lanny McDonald to the Enmax Centre. After starring with the Sugar Kings and Tigers, McDonald went on to a successful 16 year NHL career with the Toronto Maple Leafs, Colorado Rockies, and Calgary Flames, scoring 500 goals along the way and capping his career with a Stanley Cup championship in 1989.

      <p><em>January 18, 2012</em> - Oh the storylines! There was plenty going on heading into tonight’s match-up between the Lethbridge Hurricanes and Vancouver Giants at the Pacific Colosseum. Going into this game, the Hurricanes remained winless since trading Cam Braes, and were riding a three game losing skid into Vancouver. Meanwhile, their last game here was a win that snapped a seven year losing streak against the Giants.
