      <h2><a href="/article/2012/02/postgame-early-and-often/">Postgame: Early and often</a></h2>
      <p><em>February 11, 2012</em> - After a couple of disappointing losses on home ice, the Hurricanes looked to get back on the winning track against the conference’s worst team tonight. The Prince Albert Raiders may occupy the eastern conference basement, but thay have had the Hurricanes’ number this season, winning 5-2 in Prince Albert back in November and 6-3 here in Lethbridge just a couple of weeks ago. With only four points between the two teams, the ‘Canes would like to gain a little more ground to avoid the dubious distincation of finishing 12th.

      <p><em>February 11, 2012</em> - Back at the Enmax after falling short in an incomplete effort against the Moose Jaw Warriors on Wednesday night, the Hurricanes sought redemption against the Saskatoon Blades, a team fighting for position in the upper half of the WHL’s eastern conference standings.

      <p><em>February 09, 2012</em> - The question of who resides at the top of the goaltending depth chart for the Lethbridge Hurricanes was a source of much speculation early this season. After the overage cutdown deadline, the goaltending rotation was stabilized with the veteran Damien Ketlo getting the majority of the starts when healthy. While there was a glimmer of hope for a miraculous run at the playoffs has vanished, it is time for Rich Preston to reconsider his team’s goaltending strategy.

      <p><em>February 08, 2012</em> - Returning to the Enmax after a two week absence, the Hurricanes take on the Moose Jaw Warriors and the return of Cam Braes. Braes returns with 14 points in 11 games following his trade, while the Canes slipped below five hundred in the same 11 going 5 wins and 6 losses. Emotions should run high as Moose Jaw hunts down first in the East and Lethbridge seeks to shut down Cam on his return.

      <p><em>February 04, 2012</em> - With a fantastic win last night against the Brandon What Kings, the Hurricanes made their last stop on the road as the took on the Regina Pats. Looking to build on a disciplined performance, and to gain a back to back road wins, something that has been incredibly elusive this season.
Damien Ketlo got the start once more after posting 41 saves last night and playing for the final time of his WHL career in the stadium he spent 3 years calling home.

      <p><em>February 04, 2012</em> - After a disappointing loss against the Broncos, the Canes travelled into Manitoba to take on the Brandon Wheat Kings. This game gave Goaltender Liam Liston and defenseman Spencer Galbraith the chance to return to their old stomping grounds whilst the Hurricanes got to say hello again to goaltender and Washington Capitals farm player, Brandon Anderson.

      <p><em>February 01, 2012</em> - Our congratulations to Karren Neufeld, the Hurricanes’ Ultimate Fan as decided yesterday at BMO. Looking the part in her Hurricanes jersey, Karren showed plenty of personality and breezed through qualifying to win her spot in the trivia round. It took a few rounds to break the stalemate, but eventually her Hurricane knowledge won out as well to earn her the autographed jersey, chance for a trip to the Memorial Cup, and title of Ultimate Fan.

      <p><em>January 30, 2012</em> - While not mathematically make or break it, every game right now is an important one. The Canes coming off an unimpressive showing the previous night needed to step up and show the heart we&#39;ve seen in the previous months.
