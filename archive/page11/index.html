      <p><em>January 14, 2012</em> - Brody Sutter opened his first game as the 21st Captain of the Hurricanes travelling to Northern BC as the Canes took on the Cougars in back-to-back road games at the CN Centre, Prince George.

      <p><em>January 13, 2012</em> - The Hurricanes apparently made one more move on Tuesday, albeit quietly. <a href="http://blogs.theprovince.com/2012/01/12/giants-look-at-longtime-hurricane-fyten-out-with-a-knee-injury-for-their-open-20-year-old-spot/">Steve Ewen of The Province reports</a> that the Hurricanes released Austin Fyten, and the Vancouver Giants were quick to claim his rights. Ewen states that Fyten is expected to meet with the Giants’ doctors next week to assess his status and whether he might make a return in time for the post-season.

      <p><em>January 12, 2012</em> - The trade deadline has come and gone, with the Hurricanes pulling the trigger on a single deal: a blockbuster that sends captain Cam Braes to the Moose Jaw Warriors for a 2012 first round bantam draft pick and a 2013 second round bantam draft pick. The Warriors also added Vancouver Giants’ captain James Henry, ensuring plenty of veteran leadership for a team that has high hopes of a lengthy post-season run.

      <p><em>January 04, 2012</em> - Having lost the last 3 games, the Canes were looking to get back to winning ways and start 2012 off in the right fashion especially after dropping their last 2 games home and away to the Tigers. The Enmax which has been a fortress for the Canes recently, wasn&#39;t the happiest place last time around as they fell to the tabbies 5-2.

      <h2><a href="/article/2011/12/postgame-lets-put-2011-rearview-mirror/">Postgame: Let's put 2011 in the rearview mirror</a></h2>
      <p><em>December 30, 2011</em> - After having their six game home win streak unceremoniously snapped by the Tigers last night, the Hurricanes sought out a little revenge tonight at The Arena, where they’ve won twice already this season. With Tyler Kizuik returning from injury and Harrison Harper still in the line-up, the Hurricanes entered this game with nearly a complete roster. Beyond the motivation of playing the back half of a home and home with your bitter rivals, the Prince Albert Raiders have been playing strong hockey lately and managed to overtake the Hurricanes in the standings last night; there was plenty to get up for in this game tonight.
