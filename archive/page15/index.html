      <h2><a href="/article/2011/10/breaking-down-busy-trade-day/">Breaking down a busy trade day</a></h2>
      <p><em>October 16, 2011</em> - The Lethbridge Hurricanes&#39; losing streak has hit eight games, and has now claimed its first casualties. Rich Preston has been working the phones lately, it would seem, and the result is going to be a very different look to the Hurricanes&#39; blue line. Let&#39;s take a look at each of the trades in the order in which the news broke:

      <h2><a href="/article/2011/10/looking/">Looking Up</a></h2>
      <p><em>October 13, 2011</em> - Only eight games into what was supposed to be a promising season of turnaround for the Lethbridge Hurricanes, and already they find themselves near the bottom of the standings, looking up at a substantial challenge ahead of them in what is shaping up to be a competitive eastern conference.

      <p><em>October 07, 2011</em> - I&#39;ve had several people ask me lately how I think the Hurricanes will fare this season. Others have given me their opinions, often pessimistic and founded on the results of the last two seasons. These discussions have got me thinking about where I expect this team to finish the season. Rationally, reasonably, what can we expect from this team?

      <p><em>October 05, 2011</em> - With the revelation today that <a href="http://canesbroadcaster.blogspot.com/2011/10/hurricanes-moose-jaw-warriors.html">Austin Fyten will effectively miss the entire season</a>, the Lethbridge Hurricanes&#39; 20 year old situation has become considerably more complex. From the outset of camp it seemed clear that the only thing that would keep the Braes-Fyten-Sutter line from reuniting was the chance of Fyten or Sutter sticking with an AHL club. Unfortunately, the hard luck continues for Austin Fyten where injuries are concerned â€“ you&#39;ll recall that he missed substantial time as a result of two injuries in the first half of last season as well.

      <p><em>October 04, 2011</em> - This post is the first in a series that I will be running this season called <em>Freeze Frames</em>. These articles will provide some insight into the photos I take at Hurricane games throughout the year, highlighting some of my favourites and giving a little bit of narrative along the way.

      <p><em>October 03, 2011</em> - Four games in the books now, a modest .500 record, and a few home games to get a good look at the team; It&#39;s time for us to start throwing some observations and opinions around.

      <p><em>September 26, 2011</em> - Here we are, days away from the home opener. We&#39;re all excited to get a look at the new team on the ice, but we also have another summer&#39;s worth of renovations to the ENMAX Centre to take in. We got to take a tour of the building last week, and I&#39;d like to give you a sneak peek at what you can expect to see when you arrive.

      <h2><a href="/article/2011/09/what-make-damien-ketlo-trade/">What to make of the Damien Ketlo trade?</a></h2>
      <p><em>September 12, 2011</em> - News broke today that Rich Preston has made his first big roster move of the season, adding 20 year old goalie Damien Ketlo from the Regina Pats in exchange for a conditional fifth round pick in the 2012 bantam draft. <a href="http://whl.ca/article/lethbridge-hurricanes-acquire-rowat-from-pats/77223">Stop me if you&#39;ve heard this one before</a>. The timing of the deal causes one to wonder about the head coach and GM&#39;s confidence in his goaltending prospects.
