      <p><em>August 12, 2013</em> - It’s been a quiet summer here on CanesCast.ca, but things have been anything but slow for the Lethbridge Hurricanes since last season ended. With training camp only a few weeks away now, we’ve got some catching up to do.

      <p><em>February 19, 2013</em> - It&rsquo;s just a part of being a junior hockey player. A handful of players are lucky enough to play close to home, and enjoy the support of family and friends at home and the rink. Many more move away at a young age to chase a dream. With so much of the year spent away from home, opportunities to spend time with family can be few and far between. Lethbridge Hurricane players enjoyed one such opportunity this past weekend, welcoming parents and siblings to celebrate Family Day together.

      <p><em>January 05, 2013</em> - Thursday nights game against the OilKings had the home town boys put in a strong effort, but not receive any rewards. Shut out 4 - 0, the game was lost more to the play of Brossoit, then to  any sort of poor play. It always seemed like the boys were a fraction of a second behind where they needed to be, inspire of showing the effort we were hoping to see from them.

      <p><em>December 08, 2012</em> - As you probably know, we take plenty of photos at most of the Hurricanes&#39; home games, and often we&#39;ll spend some time shooting from our favourite spot: between the benches. Tonight, Remi Laurencelle just about ended up sharing the box with me.
