      <p><em>October 30, 2012</em> - A little backlog in production means we&#39;re a week or so late in posting episode 2, but here it is. Morgan makes his debut co-hosting the show while Mark takes a week off and we chat about the recent performances of Graham Hood and Russ Maxwell while admiring Ty Rimmer&#39;s new mask.

      <p><em>October 29, 2012</em> - The Lethbridge Hurricanes haven&rsquo;t forgotten about a winless October that sunk their playoffs hopes early last season, but they have moved past it. The Hurricanes of October 2012, while comprised of most of the same players as a year ago, are a very different team, and much like a locomotive pulling out of the station, the Hurricanes are picking up steam.

      <p><em>October 23, 2012</em> - <strong>Max FirePower</strong>. In deference to my colleague (good evening Mr Huxley) I have capitalized the P in firepower. An obvious Simpson&#39;s reference I am willing to piggy back on. The other more relevant reason for the title is the play of Russell Maxwell in tonights game. A dynamo the whole game; seemingly fit to play on any line combination, Russell was a highlight reel to himself. With 6 goals in the last 5 games Maxwell has been a force for the Canes in recent nights earning his chances on the top lines.

      <p><em>October 19, 2012</em> - After a split decision over the weekend and a lackluster performance on Saturday night, the Canes came into this game looking to make up for missed opportunities and take it to a Brandon Wheat Kings team that is flying at the moment with a 6-3-1-0 record after having just won the previous night edging a nervy one 7-6 the previous night against the tigers.

      <p><em>October 13, 2012</em> - The Canes were able to put down the Cougars on Friday night. A mix of solid, consistent defence and the fiery work of the Canes top line put them over the top. Outstanding plays by Axel Blomqvist, Sam McKechnie and Russ Maxwell&#39;s 2 power play goals helped the Canes bring home the 3 - 2 win.

      <p><em>October 11, 2012</em> - After a difficult road trip south of the border, the Hurricanes returned to the Enmax hoping to regroup, turn their fortunes around and bring everything back on track with what is seen by many Caniacs as the Hurricanes strongest roster of talent in the last couple of years.

      <p><em>October 05, 2012</em> - The Lethbridge Hurricanes have seen both types of player come through the system in recent years. Zach Boychuk and Luca Sbisa were drafted early and then ascended to pursue fame and fortune as professionals, while players like Cam Braes and Carter Bancks found themselves just off of the NHL radar, but winning Hurricane fans&rsquo; hearts as committed two-way players. Twice undrafted, Bancks now has something to prove.

      <p><em>September 27, 2012</em> - Josh and Mark are back with episode 1 of CanesCast Radio, recorded on location at the Enmax Centre after last night&#39;s game. We&#39;ve got plenty of discussion today, ranging from headshots, to quality of officiating, the Hurricanes&#39; injury troubles on the blue line, and how Rich Preston keeps making us look bad.

      <p><em>September 26, 2012</em> - While we have to hope that 50+ shot games are going to be the exception and not the norm it is good to see our goaltender ready and willing to take on the challenge, and prove himself worthy of it.

      <p><em>September 23, 2012</em> - Ty Rimmer knows WHL rivalries. He was, after all, part of the fierce Tri-City/Spokane feud last season. The start of the new season sees him now in Hurricane colours, jumping into a new rivalry, and the well-travelled veteran goalkeeper is game for it.
