      <h2><a href="/article/2011/11/freeze-frames-spooky-edition/">Freeze Frames: The Spooky Edition</a></h2>
      <p><em>November 01, 2011</em> - Okay, so maybe it won&#39;t be terribly spooky, since I haven&#39;t gone through the costume contest photos yet, but we&#39;ve got a jack-o-lantern and a 13 game losing streak. That sounds spooky enough for me.

      <h2><a href="/article/2011/10/what-its-lose/">What it's like to lose</a></h2>
      <p><em>October 31, 2011</em> - It&#39;s tough to come up with something to write when the Hurricanes are getting the results they&#39;ve been getting lately. There&#39;s only so much I want to talk about why the team is losing, and it just feels patronizing to try to keep being overly optimistic, spewing feel-good clich&eacute;s and trying to shift the focus to the bright future we expect for the Lethbridge Hurricanes. Indulge me, if you will, as I spend some time today dwelling on the losses and exploring what it&#39;s like to lose.

      <h2><a href="/article/2011/10/postgame-red-zone/">Postgame: In the red zone</a></h2>
      <p><em>October 30, 2011</em> - Everything to play for in this game as the Canes continue to battle against adversity and work hard to get out of the red and back into the black. Quite frankly all of us Caniacs are praying for an end to this losing streak, and know the boys have it in them to turn this around and start putting numbers in the win column. Never was there been a better opponent to face than Red Deer who served up a 4-1 loss to the Canes in Red Deer when Captain Cam got the only goal for Lethbridge.

      <p><em>October 29, 2011</em> - With the Canes on a franchise record 11 losses in a row, scoring 1 point in the last 11 games, it was time to turn things around and get back to winning ways. Having played their hearts out in the last game at the Enmax, against the Wheatkings, the Canes were looking to dig deep again and stop the rot.

      <p><em>October 25, 2011</em> - The Lethbridge Hurricanes unveiled a military-inspired jersey today to pay tribute to Canadian servicemen and women. The Hurricanes and Glenn Miller, Service Officer with General Stewart Branch #4, were part of the reveal at the Cenotaph outside of Yates Theatre. The lucky Hurricane to model the new uniform was Graham Hood.

      <p><em>October 23, 2011</em> - It was announced during Saturday&#39;s game that the Lethbridge Hurricanes will debut their new third jerseys next weekend. Well, the jerseys are sort of new. Twister was modeling one, and it should be familiar to most Hurricane fans.

      <p><em>October 22, 2011</em> - Breaking the losing streak has never been more important, especially when we have exBrandon players Liam Liston between the pipes and Spencer Galbraith in defence with us after the trade that sent Brandon Anderson east to Manitoba. However, Galbraith and Liston are not the only Canes with something to prove tonight with the Hurricanes just having passed a franchise record of 10 losses in a row everything is on the line as they look to turn things around.

      <p><em>October 21, 2011</em> - Twelve games and ten losses into the season, it&#39;s a fair question to ask: are the Lethbridge Hurricanes already out of this year&#39;s WHL playoff race?

      <p><em>October 20, 2011</em> - In our second instalment of <em>Freeze Frames</em>, we take a look at last Saturday&#39;s blow-out at the hands of the Swift Current Broncos, and a tough loss to the Kootenay Ice that stretched the Lethbridge Hurricanes&#39; losing streak to nine games.
