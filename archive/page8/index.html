      <h2><a href="/article/2012/03/community-relations-award/">Community Relations Award</a></h2>
      <p><em>March 08, 2012</em> - The first award tonight is the Player’s Bench Community Relations Award. This award is given to the Lethbridge Hurricane that best represents the team in the community.

      <h2><a href="/article/2012/03/postgame-ugly-still-counts/"> Postgame: Ugly Still Counts</a></h2>
      <p><em>March 06, 2012</em> - Tonight’s game sees a rematch with the Warriors who caused the Canes a great deal of trouble on Saturday Night. Tonight is redemption night for the Canes after a couple poor showings on the weekend which saw some unlucky breaks early in the game break their backs. Also of note for Hurricane fans: this will be the final WHL appearance for former Hurricane Cam Braes at the Enmax Centre. Thanks to the continued injury troubles up front, the Hurricanes have called up Reid Duke for his eighth game as an affiliate this season.

      <h2><a href="/article/2012/02/postgame-stepping/">Postgame: Stepping Up</a></h2>
      <p><em>February 29, 2012</em> - The road trip continues tonight in Prince Albert against the basement dwelling Raiders, and the Hurricanes look to rebound from Sunday afternoon’s loss in Edmonton. Brady Ramsay is the latest addition to the injured list after a hit in the third period of Sunday’s game. Initial prognosis was that Ramsay could miss the remainder of the season, but he is now being listed as out for a week with an upper body injury. Brody Sutter also sits tonight, day-to-day with a back injury.

      <p><em>February 29, 2012</em> - We recently took a look at how the rookies have fared with the Hurricanes this season. Now, in light of the season ending for several midget teams this week, I’d like to check in on how some of the future prospects have been looking.

      <p><em>February 26, 2012</em> - A Brandon victory over Regina last night officially put the playoffs out of the reach, leaving the Lethbridge Hurricanes looking to play the role of spoiler against the teams jostling for position in the Eastern Conference playoff race. The opponent this afternoon, the Edmonton Oil Kings, currently hold down top spot in the conference, but have been feeling the heat lately from the hard charging Moose Jaw Warriors. In their first game since since being officially eliminated, the Hurricanes have a chance to do their former captain a favour by stealing a couple of points in Edmonton.

      <p><em>February 23, 2012</em> - It’s no secret that the Lethbridge Hurricanes, beginning to emerge from a rebuild, have relied a great deal on the performance of rookies this season. Nine first year players have been regulars in the line-up for the Hurricanes this season, and we’ve seen some good performances from that cohort. Since these players are going to become the core of the team in the next couple of seasons, I thought it would be interesting to look at the impact of Hurricanes’ rookies vis-à-vis vis those of other WHL teams this season.

      <p><em>February 22, 2012</em> - The Hurricanes head out to Saskatoon for a one game road trip and the last of four meetings with the Blades this season. The Blades come into the game with a decimated defensive corps, only able to dress four healthy defencemen for this game. For the Hurricanes, both Craig Leverton and Albin Blomqvist are the scratches with upper body injuries. Damien Ketlo gets the start in goal, looking for wins in consecutive starts.

      <h2><a href="/article/2012/02/postgame-putting-down-pats/">Postgame: Putting down the Pats</a></h2>
      <p><em>February 17, 2012</em> - Tonights game faces Damien Ketlo holding off 45 saves in his previous sting against his former teammates as he gave the Canes the win on that night. The Pats lead the season series by one with the Canes in the hunt to even that up. The Canes should enter tonights game with confidence and after a strong performance in a loss that came down to the opposing teams Goaltender shutting them down on too many chances to count. That marked the second gutsy effort in a row and signs that the lack of effort that had marked a string of games may be coming to an end.

      <p><em>February 15, 2012</em> - The Hurricanes went into battle against the Brandon Wheat Kings riding a solid effort and hard earned win against the Prince Albert Raiders. The Canes looked to keep the momentum going and show some heart as they head into the seasons final games.

      <p><em>February 13, 2012</em> - Whenever someone mentions the name Dwight King, all sorts of good Hurricane memories come to mind for me. The big forward was a fourth overall bantam pick of the Hurricanes in 2004 (their highest pick ever, I believe, until drafting Jay Merkley and Ryan Pilon third overall in 2010 and 2011, respectively).
